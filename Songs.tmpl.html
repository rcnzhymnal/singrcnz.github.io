 <b>Viewing:</b> The first time you click a view/play link, the
 bottom of the page will ask you to download a browser plug-in called Scorch
 to play the file.  This plug-in will let you play and sing-along while you
 view the file.

<p>
 <b>Parts:</b> For some of the Psalms we have included parts that choir singers
 can play to help learn their part.  Just click on the correct SATB icon
 before the song name (SATB stands for Soprano, Alto, Tenor Bass).  Note
 that these parts are auto-generated from the full-part score, and may
 contain errors where there is complicated harmony.  We do not intend to fix
 these.
