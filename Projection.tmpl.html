<h1>Projection of Songs for Public Singing</h1>

<p>
 Although some powerpoint slides have been withheld from the public site,
if you <a href="Committee.htm">contact us</a>
we'd be happy to give you the entire book of slides in
various formats (Powerpoint/MediaShout, SongShow Plus).
</p>

<p>
 Note, however, that for many of the slides that we send out, your church
will need to abide by certain copyright criteria in order to project them for singing.
