Psalm 1  How blest the man

1. How blest the man who does not walk
     where wicked men would guide his feet,
     nor stand in paths with sinful men,
     nor sit upon the scorner’s seat.
   The Lord’s own law is his delight,
     his meditation day and night.

2. He shall be like a growing tree,
     well planted by the waterside,
     which in its season bears its fruit,
     and has a leaf which does not fade.
   In all to which he puts his mind
     prosperity he’ll surely find.

3. Not so the wicked! They are all
     like chaff the wind will drive away.
     They shall not in the judgment stand,
     nor sinners with the righteous stay.
   The Lord the way of just men knows;
     the sinners’ way he overthrows.


Psalm 1b  Blessed is the man

1. Blessed is the man, the man who does not walk
     in the counsel of the ungodly, blessed is that man.
     He who rejects the way, rejects the way of sin
     and who turns away from scoffing, blessed is that man.
   But his delight by day and night
     is the law of God Almighty.

2. He is like a tree, a tree that flourishes
     being planted by the water, blessed is that man!
     He will bring forth fruit, his leaf will wither not,
     for in all he does he prospers, blessed is that man.
   For his delight by day and night
     is the law of God Almighty.

3. The ungodly are not so, for they are like the chaff
     which the wind blows clean away, the ungodly are not so.
     The ungodly will not stand upon the judgment day
     nor belong to God’s own people, the ungodly will not stand.
   But God knows the way of righteous men,
     and ungodly ways will perish.

   Blessed is the man, the man who does not walk
     in the counsel of the ungodly, blessed is that man!


Psalm 2  Why now do the nations rage?

1. Why now do the nations rage,
     and the people vainly dream
     that in triumph they can wage
     war against the Lord supreme?
   His Anointed they deride,
     and the rulers plotting say:
     “Their dominion be defied,
     let us cast their chains away.”

2. But the Lord will scorn them all;
     he will laugh who sits on high.
     Then his wrath will on them fall;
     much displeased he will reply:
   “Yet according to my will
     I have set my King to reign,
     and on Zion’s holy hill
     my Anointed I maintain.”

3. His decree I will make known:
     for to me the Lord did say,
     “You are my beloved Son;
     I’ve begotten you this day.
   Ask of me, and you I’ll make
     heir to earth and nations all;
     with an iron rod you’ll break,
     dashing them in pieces small.”

4. Therefore, kings, be wise, give ear,
     listen, judges of the earth;
     serve the Lord with godly fear;
     mingle trembling with your mirth.
   True allegiance give the Son,
     lest you perish in the way,
     for his anger soon will burn.
     Blest are all who trust in him!


Psalm 3  O Lord, how are my foes increased!

1. O Lord, how are my foes increased!
     Against me many rise!
   And many speak of me and say:
     “His God no help supplies.”

2. But you’re my shield and glory, Lord!
     You lift my head up high!
   And from his holy hill the Lord
     gives answer to my cry.

3. I lay down, slept, and woke again;
     the Lord sustains my life.
   I will not fear the many foes
     who plot to cause me strife.

4. Arise, O Lord! Save me, my God!
     You’ve always struck my foes;
   the jaw and teeth of wicked men
     are broken by your blows.

5. Salvation and deliverance
     come from the Lord alone.
   O let the blessing of your grace
     be to your people shown.


Psalm 4  O hear my cry, my righteous God

1. O hear my cry, my righteous God.
     Relieve me; I’m distressed.
   Display your mercy to me now,
     and answer my request.

2. The glory of my name, O men,
     how long will you despise?
   How long will you delude yourselves,
     still searching after lies?

3. Know that the Lord has set apart
     the godly as his own;
   the Lord will hear me when I call
     and my request make known.

4. Though you are angry, do not sin.
     O search your heart; be still.
   Present a righteous sacrifice;
     trust in the Lord’s good will.

5. “O who can show us any good?”
     I hear so many say.
   O Lord, shine on us with your light;
     show us your face, I pray.

6. You filled my heart with greater joy
     than others may have found
   as they rejoiced at harvest time,
     when grain and wine abound.

7. I will lie down and sleep in peace;
     my heart will rest secure,
   for you alone, O gracious Lord,
     will keep me safe and sure.


Psalm 5  Lord Almighty, hear my words

1. Lord Almighty, hear my words,
     to my thoughts attentive be;
     hear my cry, my King, my God,
     as to you I make my plea.
   With the morning light, O Lord,
     you shall hear my voice and cry;
     and expectant I will bring
     prayer as morning sacrifice.

2. Truly you are not a God
     who delights in wickedness;
     evil shall not dwell with you,
     boasters not before your eyes.
   Lying tongues you will destroy;
     those who evil do, you hate.
     God abhors the man who loves
     violence and base deceit.

3. Grace will lead me to your house,
     there to worship reverently.
     Make your way before me straight,
     lest my foes lead me astray.
   Not one word they say is true,
     ruin brews within their heart.
     Their mouth is an open grave,
     well taught in the flatterer’s art.

4. Guilty! Catch them in their snares.
     Rebels, sinners, cast them out.
     Those who trust you, shelter them.
     Let them ever sing and shout.
   For you bless the righteous man;
     you alone, O Lord, are good;
     you surround him with your grace,
     with your favour as a shield.


Psalm 6  Lord, chasten not in anger

1. Lord, chasten not in anger,
     nor in your wrath rebuke me.
     Give me your healing word.
   My soul and body languish;
     I wait for you in anguish.
     How long, how long, O Lord?

2. Turn to me now, uphold me;
     for your love’s sake restore me.
     O save me by your grace.
   For death ends all remembrance;
     it wraps the tongue in silence.
     How can the dead sing praise?

3. Pain and distress o’erwhelm me,
     I cry all night for mercy,
     my bed is wet with tears.
   My eyes can weep no longer;
     my enemies seem stronger,
     my awful foes and fears.

4. All who love evil, leave me,
     for God has heard my weeping;
     my foes are put to shame.
   Turned back, no more to grieve me,
     they suddenly shall leave me.
     All glory to His name!


Psalm 7  O Lord my God

1. O Lord my God, my refuge is in you;
     deliver me from all those who pursue,
   lest lion-like they tear ferociously
     while there is no one to deliver me.

2. O Lord my God, if such a thing I planned,
     and if the guilt of sin is on my hand –
   if I have wronged the one at peace with me,
     or without cause have robbed my enemy –

3. then let my foe pursue relentlessly
     that he may vent his hateful spite on me,
   and let him trample me into the ground;
     so will my honour in the dust be found.

4. Arise, O Lord, in wrath against my foes,
     against the rage of all who me oppose.
   Awake, my God, let justice now abound
     for all assembled nations gathered round.

5. Rule over all the nations from on high;
     your justice to the peoples, Lord, apply.
   According to my righteousness judge me;
     look, O Most High, on my integrity.

6. O God of righteousness, you are the one
     who searches deep the heart and mind of man;
   bring to an end the wicked’s violence
     and be the righteous one’s secure defence.

7. My shield and confidence is God Most High,
     who saves the upright when to him they cry.
   God is a judge who does what’s right and fair,
     and every day his wrath God will declare.

8. If it should be that man will not repent,
     God’s sword he’ll whet, his deadly instrument,
   and he will string and bend his mighty bow
     from which his fiery arrows forth will go.

9. The one who evil in his heart conceives
     gives birth to lies and no reward receives.
   He digs a hole, he scoops it with his spade,
     then falls into the very pit he made.

10. His scheming will recoil on him instead;
     his evil will descend upon his head.
   I’ll thank the Lord who acts in righteousness;
     I’ll praise the Lord Most High; his name I’ll bless.


Psalm 8  In all the earth

1. In all the earth, O Lord our Lord,
     how glorious is your name!
     For you have set above the heavens
     your glory and your fame.
   From infants’ and from children’s lips
     you ordered praise to sound,
     to silence all your enemies,
     the wicked to confound.

2. When I regard the heavens you made,
     your fingers’ work I trace;
     I see the moon and shining stars
     which you have set in place.
   I ask myself, “What then is man
     that you should give him thought --
     the son of man, that you to him
     such gracious care have brought?”

3. You made him little less than those
     who dwell in heaven above,
     and you have crowned and honoured him
     with glory from above.
   You gave him charge of all the works
     created by your hand,
     and everything that you had made
     you gave him to command:

4. all flocks and herds, all birds and fish,
     all beasts both wild and tame.
     In all the earth, O Lord our Lord,
     how glorious is your name!


Psalm 9  Wholehearted thanksgiving

1. Wholehearted thanksgiving to you I will bring;
     in praise of your marvellous works I will sing.
   For joy I will shout and exultantly cry
     in praise of your glorious name, O Most High.

2. My enemies turn in disorderly flight;
     they stumble and perish in face of your might.
   For you have defended my right and my cause;
     you sat in just judgment, upholding your laws.

3. You threatened the nations, the wicked destroyed;
     their names you erased and forever made void.
   My foes are disgraced and completely undone,
     their cities uprooted, their memory gone.

4. The Lord sits forever as King on his throne;
     his rule is established for justice alone.
   He judges the world and he does what is right;
     he governs the nations with justice and might.

5. The Lord is a stronghold in times of distress,
     a refuge for those whom the wicked oppress.
   Your people who know you will trust in your grace;
     you’ve never forsaken those seeking your face.

6. Praise God, who in Zion has founded his throne;
     proclaim to the nations the deeds he has done.
   The cry of afflicted ones rings in his ear;
     their blood he avenges, their plea he will hear.

7. Lord, see what I suffer from malice and hate!
     Have pity, and lift me away from death’s gate,
   that I in Jerusalem’s gates may proclaim
     your mercy, and sing to the praise of your name.

8. The nations are sunk in the pit they prepared;
     their feet in the net which they hid are ensnared.
   The Lord by his justice has made himself known;
     and by their own works are the wicked cast down.

9. The wicked return to the grave’s dark abode,
     all nations and those who are heedless of God.
   But God will remember the cause of the weak;
     he will not let perish the hope of the meek.

10. Arise, O my God!  Let not man win the day;
     let nations be judged in your presence, I pray.
   O Lord, strike the nations; put fear in their breast
     to teach them that they are but human at best.


Psalm 10  O Lord, why do you stand remote?

1. O Lord, why do you stand remote
     and stay so far away?
   Why do you hide yourself from us
     when trouble comes our way?

2. The wicked in his arrogance
     hunts down the weak and poor,
   who in the snares that he has set
     are caught and held secure.

3. About the cravings of his heart
     he speaks with boastful word;
   he praises people filled with greed
     while he reviles the Lord.

4. The wicked does not seek the Lord
     because he is so proud,
   and in his inmost thoughts there is
     no room at all for God.

5. His ways are always prosperous;
     he strikes a haughty pose.
   He keeps his distance from your laws;
     he sneers at all his foes.

6. He reassures himself and says,
     “No threat will topple me –
   I will be happy evermore;
     from trouble I’ll be free.”

7. The wicked’s mouth is always full
     of curses, threats and lies;
   evil and trouble from his tongue
     continually arise.

8. He lies in wait near villages
     his victim’s blood to spill;
   he lurks in secret ambushes
     the innocent to kill.

9. Like lions crouching secretly
     he waits for helpless prey.
   He pounces on the weak and poor;
     his net drags them away.

10. His victims by his strength are crushed;
     his prey collapse and fall.
   He thinks, “God does not notice it;
     he does not see at all.”

11. Arise, Lord God, lift up your hand;
     do not forget the poor.
   Why does the wicked say of God,
     “My conduct he’ll ignore”?

12. But you, O God, do see such wrong
     and you will bring redress.
   The victim puts his trust in you;
     you help the fatherless.

13. Lord, break the wicked person’s power
     and call him to account
   for all the evil which he thought
     would never be found out.

14. The Lord will ever reign as King;
     his throne will always stand.
   The heathen nations of the world
     will perish from his land.

15. O Lord, the needy ones’ desire
     you answer from on high;
   you give encouragement to them
     and listen to their cry.

16. For you defend the fatherless
     and those who are oppressed,
   so that from fear of mortal man
     the helpless may have rest.


Psalm 11  The Lord is my refuge

1. The Lord is my refuge, how then can you say,
     “O flee like a bird to your mountain away.
   The godless, they target with bow and with dart,
     like snipers they shoot at the upright in heart.

2. “When such is the case, they foundations destroy;
     what strategy, then, can the righteous employ?”
   Be sure that the Lord in his temple on high,
     in heaven enthroned, over men casts his eye.

3. The Lord sees us all, and his eyes test each one,
     both righteous and godless in all they have done.
   His soul hates all those who wild violence pursue;
     the wicked will doubtlessly get their own due.

4. The Lord will send judgment, he’ll pour out hot coals;
     o’er all the ungodly his scorching wind rolls.
   The Lord, ever righteous, his justice portrays;
     by grace all the upright will look on his face.


Psalm 12  Help, Lord, for godly men are few

1. Help, Lord, for godly men are few;
     the faithful vanish from mankind.
     Men to their neighbours falsely speak;
     smooth speech and double talk are theirs.
   O may the Lord cut off such lips,
     the tongue that speaks so boastfully!

2. They’ve said, “Our tongue can win the day;
     words are our strength – who is our lord?”
     But says the Lord, “Now I will arise
     and for the plundered poor will act,
   and for the needy who lament,
     I’ll grant the safety which they crave.”

3. The sayings of the Lord are pure,
     like silver smelted seven times.
     You, Lord, indeed will keep us safe,
     you’ll ever guard us from this race.
   The wicked freely strut about
     when vileness is esteemed by men.


Psalm 13  How long will you forget me, Lord?

1. How long will you forget me, Lord,
     and hide your face from me?
     How long must I with heavy heart
     endure anxiety?
   How long, how long will enemies
     boast triumph over me?

2. Come close to me and answer, Lord,
     bring light to my sad eyes,
     or I will sleep the sleep of death,
     reviled by enemies.
   Then they will say, “What can you do?
     We triumphed over you!”

3. But I have trusted in your love
     and in your saving grace.
     And I will sing to God the Lord
     my thankful hymns of praise,
   for every hour and day I see
     the Lord is good to me.


Psalm 14  The fool speaks in his heart

1. The fool speaks in his heart;
     “There is no God,” he says.
     They are corrupt, their deeds are vile;
     none walk in godly ways.
   The Lord looks down from heav-en
     upon the human race,
     to see if any understand,
     if any seek God’s face.

2. They all have turned aside;
     corrupt they have become.
     Not one of them does any good –
     no, not a single one.
   Will sinners never learn?
     My people they’ve devoured
     as if they were consuming bread;
     they never seek the Lord.

3. Struck down they are with dread,
     for God is with the just.
     You evildoers shame the poor,
     but in the Lord they trust.
   May help from Zion come,
     the Lord his captives bring!
     And then let Jacob’s tribes rejoice;
     let Israel gladly sing.


Psalm 15  Who, O Lord, with thee abiding

1. Who, O Lord, with thee abiding,
     in thy house shall be thy guest?
     Who, his feet to Zion turning,
     in thy holy hill shall rest?
   He that ever walks uprightly,
     does the right without a fear;
     when he speaks, he speaks not lightly,
     but with truth and love sincere.

2. He that slanders not his brother,
     does no evil to a friend;
     to reproaches of another
     he refuses to attend.
   Wicked men win not his favour,
     but the good who fear the Lord;
     from his vow he will not waver,
     though it bring him sad reward.

3. Freely to the needy lending,
     no excess he asks again;
     and the innocent befriending,
     he desires not praise of men.
   Doing this, and evil spurning,
     he shall nevermore be moved;
     this the man with thee sojourning,
     this the man by thee approved.


Psalm 16  Protect me, O my God

1. Protect me, O my God;
     you are my refuge true.
     I said, “You are my Lord: I have
     no good apart from you.”
   The godly in the land,
     for holiness renowned –
     they are the glorious ones, in whom
     all my delight is found.

2. Their sorrows will increase
     who on false gods rely.
     I will not sacrifice to them;
     their worship I defy.
   O Lord, you are to me
     my cup and portion sure;
     the share that is assigned to me
     you guard and keep secure.

3. The land allotted me
     is in a pleasant site;
     and surely my inheritance
     to me is a delight.
   I’ll praise the Lord my God,
     whose counsel guides my choice;
     and even in the night my heart
     recalls instruction’s voice.

4. Before me constantly
     I set the Lord alone.
     Because he is at my right hand
     I’ll not be overthrown.
   Therefore my heart is glad;
     my tongue with joy will sing.
     My body too will rest secure
     in hope unwavering.

5. For you will not allow
     my soul in death to stay,
     nor will you leave your Holy One
     to see the tomb’s decay.
   You have made known to me
     the path of life divine.
     Bliss shall I know at your right hand;
     joy from your face will shine.


Psalm 16b  Protect me, God

1. Protect me, God: I trust in you.
     I say to you, “You are my Lord;
   on you my happiness depends.”
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.

2. Your people are a chosen race,
     and I delight in faithful friends,
   but pagan ways I will not share.
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.

3. Lord God, you are my food and drink;
     my work for you is joy indeed;
   glad is the heritage that’s mine.
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.

4. Thank you, my Lord, for warning me;
     by night and day you guide my thoughts.
   With you before me, I stand firm.
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.

5. So now I’m glad in heart and soul,
     for I have found security –
   among the dead I shall not rot.
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.

6. Not death, but life, shall be my path;
     abundant joy your presence grants,
   an honoured place, and happiness.
     Protect me, God: I trust in you.


Psalm 17  Lord, hear my righteous plea

1. Lord, hear my righteous plea
     and listen to my cry;
   it does not rise deceitfully
     or come from lips that lie.

2. Declare me innocent
     and vindicate my name;
   Lord, may your eye see what is right
     and free me from all blame.

3. Though you examine me
     and probe my heart and mind,
   and though you test me in the night,
     yet nothing will you find.

4. I said, “I will not sin
     in anything I say.”
   From those who practice violence
     I have kept far away.

5. From every evil path
     by your word I’m preserved.
   My feet have held to all your ways;
     from them I have not swerved.

6. I call on you, O God,
     for you will answer me;
   O turn your ear towards my prayer
     and hear my earnest plea.

7. Display your steadfast love
     and save with your right hand
   all those who flee for help to you
     when foes against them stand.

8. In shadow of your wings
     hide me in times of strife;
   and as the apple of your eye
     preserve and guard my life.

9. Hide me from ruthless foes
     who follow wicked ways,
   from those who circle me about
     and seek to end my days.

10. They close their callous hearts;
     they speak with swelling pride.
   They dog my steps; my enemies
     are found on every side.

11. They fix their eyes on me
     to cast me to the ground.
   Like hungry lions stalking prey,
     they crouch without a sound.

12. Arise, confront my foes
     and bring them down, O Lord,
   deliver me from wicked hands
     and free me by your sword.

13. Save me by your right hand
     from all such people, Lord,
   from mortal men who in this life
     will have their sole reward.

14. You fill them with good things;
     their sons are satisfied.
   They leave their children all the wealth
     which they have set aside.

15. But I in righteousness
     your face will surely see;
   and with your likeness, when I wake,
     I satisfied will be.


Psalm 18  I love you, Lord!

1. I love you, Lord! You are my strength.
     A fortress is the Lord to me –
     my rock and my deliverer;
     for refuge to my God I flee.
   He is my stronghold and my shield,
     the Lord who saves me by his might.
     I’ll call on him and give him praise.
     I’m saved; he puts my foes to flight.

2. The cords of death entangled me;
     destruction hit me like a wave.
     Encircled by the snares of death,
     I faced the terrors of the grave.
   In my distress I called on God;
     I cried out to the Lord for aid.
     He from his temple heard my voice;
     he listened to the prayer I made.

3. The earth before God’s anger quaked,
     the mountains’ deep foundations shook;
     Consuming fire blazed from his mouth,
     and from his nostrils came forth smoke.
   The heavens parted, he came down;
     beneath his feet the dark clouds lay.
     Upon the cherubim he flew;
     on wings of wind he made his way.

4. He made the dark his canopy,
     dark rain clouds swirling in the sky.
     From brightness of his presence came
     clouds, hail and lightning from on high.
   The Lord Most High sent forth his voice;
     his thunder from the heavens pealed.
     His arrows scattered all his foes;
     his lightning drove them from the field.

5. The valleys of the sea lay bare
     and earth’s foundation deep and vast,
     when your rebuke went forth, O Lord –
     the pow-er of your nostrils’ blast.
   From heav’n he reached to grasp my hand
     and lift me as the waters rose;
     he saved me from my enemy,
     from all my overpowering foes.

6. They threatened me in my distress,
     but God stood by me in my plight.
     He brought me out and set me free,
     because in me he took delight.
   According to my righteousness
     the Lord dealt with me faithfully;
     because my hands were clean from sin,
     the Lord my God rewarded me.

7. For I have kept the ways of God;
     from him I have not turned away.
     I have not strayed from his decrees;
     his statutes ever with me stay.
   Before the Lord I’ve kept myself
     from blame and all transgression free.
     Since in his sight my hands were clean,
     the Lord my God rewarded me.

8. With faithful people you keep faith,
     and to the blameless you are good.
     With pure men you yourself are pure,
     but with the crooked you are shrewd.
   You save the humble and the meek,
     but bring the proud down from their height.
     You, Lord, will keep my lamp aflame;
     God turns my darkness into light.

9. With help from God I can advance
     against a troop and rout them all,
     and with the aid my God will give
     I can leap over any wall.
   For perfect is the way of God;
     no flaw is found within his word.
     To all who put their trust in him
     a shield and refuge is the Lord.

10. For who is God except the Lord?
     Besides our God, who is the rock?
     He is the God who gives me strength,
     and he perfects the path I walk.
   He makes my feet like feet of deer;
     upon the heights he makes me stand.
     My arms can bend a bow of bronze;
     in skills of war he trains my hand.

11. Your right hand gives me victory;
     you stoop down low to make me great.
     So that my footsteps do not trip,
     you smooth the pathway for my feet.
   I chased and overtook my foes,
     I did not turn till they were slain.
     I crushed them all beneath my feet,
     they fell and could not rise again.

12. With strength you armed me for the fight;
     my foes you humbled at my feet.
     You made them turn their backs in flight;
     and their destruction was complete.
   They cried for help, but none could save;
     they cried to God – no answer came.
     I beat them fine as wind-borne dust;
     like wayside dirt I scattered them.

13. You set me over many lands;
     you saved me from my enemy.
     A people whom I did not know
     are in subjection now to me.
   The moment that they hear my voice
     they cringe before me and obey.
     In fear they tremble and lose heart;
     they leave their strongholds in dismay.

14. The Lord lives!  Praise be to my rock!
     My Saviour God exalted be!
     He has avenged me, and subdued
     rebellious peoples under me.
   You saved me from my enemies,
     exalting me above my foes;
     you rescued me from violent men
     who sought my kingdom to oppose.

15. Therefore among the nations, Lord,
     your praise in song I will proclaim;
     before the peoples of the world
     I’ll sing the glory of your name.
   You give your king great victories;
     your lovingkindness you will pour
     on David, your anointed one,
     and his descendants evermore.


Psalm 19  The spacious heavens declare

1. The spacious heav’ns declare
     the glory of our God;
     the wide expanse displays
     his handiwork abroad;
   from day to day they utter speech,
     and night to night they knowledge teach.

2. Aloud they do not speak;
     they utter forth no word,
     nor into language break;
     their voice is never heard,
   yet through the world their truth extends,
     their words to earth’s remotest ends.

3. In heav’n God pitched a tent,
     a dwelling for the sun,
     which like a bridegroom comes,
     or strong man keen to run.
   Its course from east to west complete –
     there’s nothing hidden from its heat.

4. Jehovah’s perfect law
     restores the soul again;
     his testimony sure
     makes wise the simple one;
   the precepts of the Lord are right
     and fill the heart with great delight.

5. The Lord’s commands are clear,
     light to the eyes restore;
     the fear of God is pure,
     enduring evermore;
   his judgments, let the world confess,
     are wholly truth and righteousness.

6. They’re more to be desired
     than stores of finest gold;
     than honey from the comb
     more sweetness far they hold.
   With warnings they your servant guard,
     in keeping them is great reward.

7. His errors who can know?
     Forgive my hidden sin;
     keep me from wilful sins,
     nor let them o’er me reign;
   and blameless then I shall appear,
     and be from great transgressions clear.

8. Let all the words I speak
     and all the thoughts within
     come up before your sight
     and your approval win,
   O Lord, you are a rock to me;
     you have redeemed and set me free.


Psalm 19b  The heavens declare thy glory

1. The heav’ns declare thy glory,
     the firmament thy power;
     day unto day the story
     repeats from hour to hour;
   night unto night replying,
     proclaims in every land,
     O Lord, with voice undying,
     the wonders of thy hand.

2. The sun with royal splendour
     goes forth to chant thy praise,
     and moonbeams soft and tender
     their gentler anthem raise;
   o’er every tribe and nation
     the music strange is poured,
     the song of all creation
     to thee, creation’s Lord.

3. All heav’n on high rejoices
     to do its Maker’s will;
     the stars with solemn voices
     resound thy praises still;
   so let my whole behaviour,
     thoughts, words and actions be,
     O Lord, my strength, my Saviour,
     one ceaseless song to thee.


Psalm 20  The Lord answer you

1. The Lord answer you when you cry in distress;
     may Jacob’s God keep you, whose name you confess.
   May God send assistance from his holy place,
     and grant you from Zion support by his grace.

2. May God keep in mind every sacrifice made;
     accept on the altar your offerings laid.
   And may he fulfil the desire of your heart –
     success to each one of your plans to impart.

3. With joy we will shout when your victory’s won;
     we’ll lift up our banners in God’s name alone.
   And so may the Lord hear your earnest request,
     and answer your prayers as it seems to him best.

4. Now truly I know that the Lord from above
     protects his anointed in covenant love;
   from heav’n in his holiness God hears his cry,
     and saves by the pow’r of his right hand on high.

5. In horses or chariots some trust for defence,
     but in our Lord’s name is our strong confidence.
   They’re brought to their knees, while in strength we arise.
     O Lord, save the king!  Hear and answer our cries!


Psalm 21  O Lord, in your strength

1. O Lord, in your strength how the king is exultant!
     How great is his joy in the triumphs you bring!
   To him you have granted his heart’s deepest longing;
     you answered the plea from the lips of the king.

2. You welcomed him richly with blessings of goodness;
     a crown of fine gold you have placed on his head.
   He asked you for life, and you gave him it freely –
     abundance of days, that his years should not end.

3. Through triumphs you gave his renown is exalted,
     and you have bestowed on him splendour and grace.
   You surely have granted him blessings eternal;
     you filled him with joy by the light of your face.

4. For the king puts his trust in the Lord high above;
     unshaken he stands through the Lord’s steadfast love.

5. Your hand will lay hold upon all your opponents;
     your right hand will seize all the foes in your path.
   You’ll set them ablaze with your glorious appearance;
     you’ll swallow them up in the fire of your wrath.

6. From earth you will utterly wipe out their offspring.
     They plot wicked schemes but will never prevail
   because, when you aim with your bow at the ready,
     you’ll make them turn back and their courage will fail.

7. Be exalted, O Lord, in the strength of your arm;
     we praise your great might to the sound of a psalm.


Psalm 22  My God, my God

1. My God, my God, O why have you
     in my distress forsaken me?
   O why so far from giving help
     and from my agonising plea?
   All day, my God, I cry in vain;
     by night, but no relief I gain.

2. But still you are the holy one;
     in Israel’s praise you are enthroned.
   In you our fathers put their trust,
     they trusted and were not disowned;
   to you they cried; deliverance came;
     for they had trusted in your name.

3. Reproached by men, by all despised,
     a worm and not a man am I;
   all those who see me laugh in scorn;
     they shake their heads and taunting cry:
   “He trusts the Lord! Let him defend
     and save him if he is his friend.”

4. Yet from the womb you brought me forth;
     entrusted me to mother’s breast.
   From birth dependent on your care;
     from birth my God in whom I rest.
   Be not far off, for grief is nigh;
     there’s none on whom I can rely.

5. Bulls circle me, strong bulls surround,
     like lions roaring for their prey;
   they open wide their mouths at me.
     Like water, my life’s poured away.
   My bones stick out, my heart’s like wax:
     it’s melting right away in me.

6. My mouth is dry like pottery,
     so that my tongue sticks to my jaws.
   You’ll bring me to the dust of death.
     A pack of dogs surrounds my course;
   upon me comes a wicked crew;
     my hands and feet they pierce right through.

7. I look upon my weakened frame
     while they with pleasure gloat and stare.
   My clothes they share among themselves,
     and for my tunic cast lots there.
   But be not far from me, O Lord;
     my strength, your help to me afford.

8. Deliver me from their strong swords;
     my precious life – it’s all I have –
   deliver from the power of dogs.
     O save me from the lion’s mouth,
   from the wild oxen’s horns that rend –
     Ah! now you hear and answer send!

9. To all my brothers I’ll declare
     the glory of your holy name.
   I’ll praise you where the people meet.
     You who fear God, his praise proclaim!
   All sons of Jacob, praise his grace,
     and stand in awe, O Israel’s race!

10. For he despised not, nor abhorred,
     the afflicted man’s most wretched state;
   he has not turned away his face
     from one who was in trouble great.
   And when he cried to him in grief
     he heard his prayer and sent relief.

11. Within the congregation great
     I offer praise you have supplied.
   I’ll pay my vows with those who fear;
     the meek will eat, be satisfied.
   Those who seek God will him adore;
     your hearts will prosper evermore!

12. All ends of earth remember will,
     and they’ll return unto the Lord.
   The families of the nations then
     to him their homage will accord,
   because the Lord the kingdom owns;
     he rules above all earthly thrones!

13. Earth’s rich will eat and worship him;
     the poor and destitute bow low.
   The race to come will serve his will,
     for what the Lord has done they’ll know.
   And to each age that will unfold,
     his righteous acts will all be told!


Psalm 22b  Amid the thronging worshippers

1. Amid the thronging worshippers
     Jehovah will I bless;
     before my brethren, gathered there,
     his name will I confess.
   Come, praise him, ye that fear the Lord,
     ye children of his grace;
     with rev’rence sound his glories forth
     and bow before his face.

2. The burden of the sorrowful
     the Lord will not despise;
     he has not turned from those that mourn,
     he hearkens to their cries.
   His goodness makes me join the throng
     where saints his praise proclaim,
     and there will I fulfil my vows
     ’mid those who fear his name.

3. He feeds with good the humble soul
     and satisfies the meek,
     and they shall live and praise the Lord
     who for his mercy seek.
   The ends of all the earth take thought,
     the nations seek the Lord;
     they worship him, the King of kings,
     in earth and heaven adored.


Psalm 23  The Lord’s my shepherd

1. The Lord’s my shepherd, I’ll not want,
     he makes me down to lie
   in pastures green; he leadeth me
     the quiet waters by.

2. My soul he doth restore again,
     and me to walk doth make
   within the paths of righteousness,
     e’en for his own name’s sake.

3. Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
     yet will I fear no ill,
   for thou art with me, and thy rod
     and staff me comfort still.

4. A table thou hast furnished me
     in presence of my foes;
   my head thou dost with oil anoint,
     and my cup overflows.

5. Goodness and mercy all my life
     shall surely follow me,
   and in God’s house forevermore
     my dwelling place shall be.


Psalm 24  The earth and the riches

1. The earth and the riches with which it is stored,
     the world and its dwellers belong to the Lord,
   for he on the seas its foundation has laid,
     and firm on the waters its pillars has stayed.

2. O who shall the mount of Jehovah ascend?
     or who in the place of his holiness stand?
   The man of pure heart and of hands without stain,
     who has not sworn falsely nor loved what is vain.

3. He shall from Jehovah a blessing receive;
     the God of salvation shall righteousness give.
   Thus looking to him is a whole blessed race,
     all those who, like Jacob, are seeking your face.

4. O gates, lift your heads!  Ageless doors, lift them high!
     The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!
   O who is the King that in glory draws near?
     The Lord, mighty Lord of the battle is here!

5. O gates, lift your heads!  Ageless doors, lift them high!
     The great King of glory to enter draws nigh!
   This great King of glory, O who can he be?
     Jehovah of hosts!  King of glory is he!


Psalm 25  Lord, I lift my soul to thee

1. Lord, I lift my soul to thee,
     O my God, I trust thy might;
     let not foes exult o’er me,
     shame me not before their sight.
   Yea, may none be put to shame,
     none who wait for thee to bless;
     but dishonoured be their name
     who without a cause transgress.

2. Lord, to me thy ways make known,
     guide in truth and teach thou me;
     thou my Saviour art alone,
     all the day I wait for thee.
   Lord, remember in thy love
     all thy mercies manifold,
     tender mercies from above,
     changeless from the days of old.

3. Sins of youth remember not,
     nor my trespasses record;
     let not mercy be forgot,
     for thy goodness’ sake, O Lord.
   Just and good the Lord abides,
     he his way will sinners show,
     he the meek in justice guides,
     making them his way to know.

4. Grace and truth shall mark the way
     where the Lord his own will lead,
     if his word they still obey
     and his testimonies heed.
   For thy name’s sake hear thou me,
     for thy mercy, Lord, I wait;
     pardon mine iniquity,
     for my sin is very great.

5. He who walks in godly fear
     in the path of truth shall go;
     peace shall be his portion here,
     and his sons all good shall know.
   They that fear and love the Lord
     shall his faithful friendship know;
     he will grace to them accord,
     and his faithful covenant show.

6. Ever are my longing eyes
     on the Lord, whose watchful care,
     when my foes their plots devise,
     keeps my feet from every snare.
   Turn to me, thy grace impart,
     I am desolate indeed;
     great the troubles of my heart;
     save thou me, O Lord, I plead.

7. Look on mine afflicted state,
     freely all my sins forgive;
     mark my foes, their cruel hate;
     keep my soul and let me live.
   Shame me not; I hide in thee;
     truth and right preserve me still;
     mark thy people, Lord my God,
     save thou them from every ill.


Psalm 25b  Lord, to you my soul is lifted

1. Lord, to you my soul is lifted.
     Let me never be ashamed
   that I trust in you to keep me
     though I seem to wait in vain.
   Lord, remember in your love;
     in your holy will instruct me.
   Lord, do not remember sins
     of those younger years behind me.

2. Lord of cov-e-nant and goodness,
     pardon and correct my sin.
   They who worship you and fear you
     choose the paths you choose for them.
   They and all their family
     shall possess the earth forever.
   You, O Lord, will be their friend.
     From the snare you will deliver.

3. Turn to me in grace and mercy,
     as I suffer all alone.
   Take away my sin and sadness,
     all the trouble I have known.
   May my fierce and spiteful foes
     not succeed to harm and curse me.
   In your faithfulness I hope.
     On your people, Lord, have mercy.


Psalm 26  Lord, speak for me, for I am yours

1. Lord, speak for me, for I am yours;
     and test my mind and heart.
   I walk with steady trust in you,
     nor from your ways depart.

2. Try me, O Lord, if I be true
     and walk in righteousness.
   Your love forever leads my way;
     I trust your faithfulness.

3. I do not sit with those who cheat –
     the false who love pretence.
   I do not follow where they go,
     nor count them as my friends.

4. I wash my hands in innocence
     and seek your altar, Lord,
   and, singing there with thankful voice,
     your mighty works record.

5. I love your house, O mighty Lord,
     I love the holy place
   where you in your great glory dwell;
     you visit us in grace.

6. O do not sweep me down to death
     with those who thirst for blood;
   their right hands overflow with bribes;
     they turn away from good.

7. I walk in my integrity;
     redeem me, Lord, in grace.
   Securely now I stand, O Lord;
     in worship I bring praise.


Psalm 27  Jehovah is my light

1. Jehovah is my light
     and my salvation near;
     who shall my soul affright
     or cause my heart to fear?
   While God, my strength, my life sustains,
     secure from fear my soul remains.

2. When evildoers came
     to make my life their prey,
     they stumbled in their shame
     and fell in sore dismay;
   though hosts make war on every side,
     still fearless I in God confide.

3. My one request has been,
     and still this prayer I raise,
     that I may dwell within
     God’s house through all my days,
   Jehovah’s beauty to admire,
     and in his temple to inquire.

4. When troubles round me swell,
     when fears and dangers throng,
     securely I will dwell
     in his pavilion strong;
   within the covert of his tent
     he hides me till the storm is spent.

5. Uplifted on a rock
     above my foes around,
     amid the battle shock
     my song shall still resound;
   then joyful offerings I will bring,
     Jehovah’s praise my heart shall sing.

6. Lord, hear me when I cry! 
     O answer me in grace!
     Each time I hear you say,
     “Enquire and seek my face,”
   my heart in glad response will speak,
     “Your face, O Lord, I’ll always seek.”

7. Hide not your face from me,
     your servant now, I pray;
     the day you angry be
     O turn me not away!
   You’ve been my help. Forsake me not!
     God, my salvation, leave me not!

8. Though parents may betray,
     the Lord will care for me.
     Teach me, O Lord, your way;
     on level path lead me.
   For all my foes in ambush wait;
     my way is lined with those who hate.

9. O to my foes’ desire
     hand me not over now!
     They cunningly conspire
     their charges false to vow.
   Their ev’ry breath is cruelty;
     how hopeless seems my cause to be!

10. O had I not believed
     that I would surely see
     the goodness of the Lord
     with those that living be…
   Wait for the Lord! With strength restored,
     be brave in heart. Wait for the Lord.


Psalm 28  To you, O Lord, I cry

1. To you, O Lord, I cry,
     you are my rock alone;
   and Lord, if you will silent be,
     then to the pit I'm gone.
   For mercy now I raise my plea;
     you are my help alone.

2. To your most holy place
     I lift my hands again.
   O do not class me with the vile,
     along with wicked men,
   who outwardly portray a smile
     but harbour ill within.

3. Requite their evil deeds,
     their practices repay!
   Since they are blind to God’s good deeds,
     let them not see the day.
   But I shall praise the Lord my strength,
     who listens when I pray.

4. My joyful heart trusts him,
     and thankfully I sing.
   The Lord our strength and shield abides,
     our saviour and our king.
   O save and bless, and shepherd us,
     and home, Lord, safely bring!


Psalm 29  O give to Jehovah, you sons

1. O give to Jehovah, you sons of the mighty –
     both glory and strength to Jehovah accord!
   O give to the name of the Lord his great honour;
     in splendour of holiness worship the Lord!

2. The voice of Jehovah resounds on the waters!
     The glo-ri-ous God thunders forth from the height!
   The Lord is upon the great sweep of the waters –
     the Lord’s voice in splendour, the Lord’s voice in might!

3. The voice of the Lord breaks in pieces the cedars –
     Jehovah rips Lebanon’s cedars apart!
   The slopes of Mount Hermon – like calves they are leaping –
     and Lebanon’s hills like young antelope start!

4. The voice of the Lord strikes with flashes of lightning
     and causes the fi-er-y flashes to break!
   The voice of the Lord makes the wilderness tremble –
     the Lord makes the desert of Kadesh to shake!

5. The voice of the Lord makes the deer to give birth;
     the high standing forest of trees it strips bare!
   And all of the length and the breadth of his temple,
     and all things within it, his glory declare!

6. The Lord on his throne sat above the great deluge;
     the Lord now is King, and his reign will not cease!
   The Lord is the one who gives strength to his people;
     the Lord is the one who will bless them with peace!


Psalm 30  O Lord, I will exalt your name

1. O Lord, I will exalt your name
     for you have rescued me;
     you did not let my foes rejoice
     and gloat triumphantly.
   Lord God, in need I cried to you
     and you restored my health.
     O Lord, you brought me from the grave
     and saved my soul from death.

2. You holy ones, sing to the Lord;
     sing out with joyful voice.
     When you recall his holy name,
     then praise him and rejoice.
   His anger but a moment lasts;
     lifelong his favour stays.
     Though tears may last throughout the night,
     joy comes with morning’s rays.

3. “I never shall be moved,” I said
     in my prosperity.
     You made my mountain firm and strong
     when you, Lord, favoured me.
   But when you hid your face from me
     my heart was terrified.
     To you, O Lord, I called aloud;
     for mercy, Lord, I cried.

4. What gain will my destruction bring
     if I descend to death?
     Will dust proclaim your faithfulness
     or praise you with its breath?
   Hear as I cry, O Lord my God,
     and listen to my plea.
     Come to my aid in my distress;
     have mercy, Lord, on me.

5. You turned my wailing into dance;
     no longer was I sad.
     My sackcloth gone, you gave me clothes
     of joy, and I was glad.
   Therefore my heart will sing to you
     and never cease to praise;
     to your great name, O Lord my God,
     I will give thanks always.


Psalm 31  In you, Lord, I take refuge

1. In you, Lord, I take refuge;
     ashamed let me not be.
     Your righteousness eternal
     express by saving me.
   Incline your ear to hear me;
     with speed deliver me.
     To me O be a strong rock,
     a fort to rescue me.

2. You are my rock and fortress;
     for your sake lead and guide.
     Free me from nets they’ve hidden;
     my stronghold you abide.
   I now commit my spirit
     into your outstretched hand.
     I know you have redeemed me,
     Lord God of truths that stand.

3. I hate those serving idols;
     my trust is in the Lord.
     I’ll triumph in your mercy;
     for anguish you regard.
   You’ve known my soul’s afflictions,
     kept me from hostile hand.
     My feet you have established
     where they have room to stand.

4. O Lord, have mercy on me,
     for anguish fills my life;
     my eye, my soul, my body
     are all consumed with grief
   My life is drained by sorrow,
     my years with sighing spent;
     I’ve lost my strength by sinning;
     my bones are weak and bent.

5. To all my foes a byword,
     a dread to those near me,
     a scorn to all my neighbours –
     at sight of me they flee.
   Like dead men I’m forgotten,
     a broken jar thrown out.
     I’ve slanders heard of many,
     and fear is all about.

6. When foes conspire against me,
     my murder meditate,
     in you, O Lord, I’m trusting;
     “You are my God,” I state.
   My times are all in your hand;
     free me from foes who chase.
     Your face shine on your servant;
     O save me in your grace.

7. Let me not be ashamed, Lord,
     because on you I call.
     Ashamed shall be the wicked,
     as dead men silenced all.
   All false lips shall be silenced,
     whose speech is insolent,
     who boldly blame the righteous
     and proudly show contempt.

8. How great the good you’ve treasured
     for them who worship you,
     prepared for those who trust you,
     where sons of men may view.
   You by your presence hide them
     from all men plotting wrongs;
     you keep them in your shelter
     safe from the strife of tongues.

9. The Lord be ever blessed,
     for he has made me know
     the mercy and protection
     his city walls bestow.
   I said when filled with panic,
     “I’m cut off from your eyes!”
     yet when to you I called out,
     you heard my pleading cries.

10. O love the Lord, you godly!
     The Lord the faithful keeps,
     but he repays the haughty,
     that what he sows he reaps.
   Be strong! He’ll keep refreshing
     our heart with courage great;
     O do with hope and patience
     upon Jehovah wait.


Psalm 32  How blest is he whose trespass

1. How blest is he whose trespass
     has freely been forgiven,
     whose sin is wholly covered
     before the sight of heaven.
   Blest he to whom Jehovah
     will not impute his sin,
     who has a guileless spirit,
     whose heart is true within.

2. While I kept guilty silence,
     my strength was spent with grief;
     thy hand was heavy on me;
     my soul found no relief.
   But when I owned my trespass,
     my sin hid not from thee,
     when I confessed transgression,
     then thou forgavest me.

3. So let the godly seek thee
     in times when thou art near;
     no whelming floods shall reach them,
     nor cause their hearts to fear.
   In thee, O Lord, I hide me,
     thou savest me from ill,
     and songs of thy salvation
     my heart with rapture thrill.

4. “I graciously will teach thee
     the way that thou shalt go,
     and with mine eye upon thee 
     my counsel make thee know.
   But be ye not unruly,
     or slow to understand,
     be not perverse, but willing
     to heed my wise command.”

5. The sorrows of the wicked
     in number shall abound,
     but those that trust Jehovah,
     his mercy shall surround.
   Then in the Lord be joyful,
     in song lift up your voice;
     be glad in God, ye righteous;
     rejoice, ye saints, rejoice!


Psalm 33  Joyfully sing to the Lord

1. Joyfully sing to the Lord, all you righteous;
     for it is good that the upright give praise.
   With harp and lyre praise the Lord and make music;
     with shouts of joy, a new song to him raise.

2. Righteous and true is the word God has spoken;
     all the Lord’s actions his faithfulness prove.
   He loves true righteousness, judgment and justice;
     all earth is full of his unfailing love.

3. By the Lord’s word were the heavens created,
     their starry host by the breath from his lips.
   All the sea’s waters he gathers together
     and in his storehouses lays up the deeps.

4. Let all the world fear the Lord in his greatness;
     rev’rence his name, all you peoples of earth!
   For when he spoke, all things came into being;
     when he commanded, then all things stood forth.

5. Foiled by the Lord are the plans of the nations;
     thwarted by him are the people’s designs.
   But the Lord’s purposes stand firm forever;
     his plans endure through all ages and times.

6. Favoured and blest is the nation he’s chosen,
     whose God the Lord is throughout every age;
   Blest are the people he called to be near him,
     those whom he chose as his own heritage.

7. From heaven’s height the Lord looks down and watches;
     he sees mankind from his own dwelling place.
   He who has moulded the hearts of all people
     knows every deed of the whole human race.

8. No king is saved by the size of his army;
     no warrior lives by the strength of his hand.
   Vain is man’s trust in a horse for deliverance,
     nor by its strength can it victory command.

9. But the Lord’s eyes are on those who revere him,
     those who rely on his unfailing love;
   So that from famine and death he may save them,
     giving them life by his power from above.

10. We wait in hope for the Lord, our defender;
     trusting his holy name, our hearts are blest.
   Lord, may your unfailing love rest upon us,
     just as in you our sure hope has been placed.


Psalm 34  The Lord I will at all times bless

1. The Lord I will at all times bless
     and praise him with my voice.
     Because I glory in the Lord,
     let troubled souls rejoice.
   O let us magnify the Lord;
     exalt his name with me.
   I sought the Lord; his answer came:
     from fears he set me free.

2. They look to him and shine with joy;
     they are not put to shame.
     This suffering man cried to the Lord;
     from him deliverance came.
   The angel of the Lord surrounds
     and guards continually
   all those who fear and honour him;
     he sets his people free.

3. Come, taste and see – the Lord is good;
     who trusts in him is blest.
     O fear the Lord, you saints; with need
     you will not be oppressed.
   Young lions may grow weak and faint
     and hunger for their food,
   but those who wait upon the Lord
     will not lack any good.

4. Come here, my children! Gather round
     and listen to my word;
     and I will help you understand
     how you may fear the Lord.
   Does anyone delight in life
     and long to see good days?
   Then keep your tongue from evil speech,
     your lips from lying ways.

5. Depart and turn from evil paths
     and practise what is right.
     Desire to know the way of peace;
     pursue it with your might.
   The Lord’s eyes are upon the just;
     he listens to their plea.
   The wicked he rejects, and blots
     from earth their memory.

6. The righteous cry; the Lord responds
     and frees them when distressed.
     The Lord draws near the broken heart
     and rescues the depressed.
   From all the troubles of the just
     the Lord will set him free.
   The Lord protects his every bone,
     and broken none will be.

7. The wicked are condemned to death,
     all those who hate the just.
   God saves his own; they’re not condemned,
     for in the Lord they trust.


Psalm 35  Lord, plead my case

1. Lord, plead my case when I am charged
     by foes maliciously;
     and fight for me when they attack
     and vent their spite on me.
   Take up your shield! Come to my aid!
     Speak to my soul and say,
     “I’m your salvation.” With your spear
     cut off my enemies’ way.

2. May those who seek to take my life
     endure disgrace and shame;
     may those who plot my overthrow
     turn back the way they came.
   And may the angel of the Lord
     drive them away like chaff.
     May he pursue them all along
     a dark and slippery path.

3. Since they have spread a net for me
     without a cause at all,
     and for no reason dug a pit
     that in it I might fall,
   let ruin seize them, and let them
     in their own net be caught;
     may they instead fall in their pit
     and so to death be brought.

4. Then will my soul rejoice in God
     and in his saving name.
     “Who is a God like you, O Lord?”
     my heart and soul exclaim.
   “The poor you rescue from the hands
     of those who are too strong;
     you save the poor and weak from those
     who rob and do them wrong.”

5. Malicious witnesses rise up
     and falsely slander me;
     I have no knowledge of the things
     they ask accusingly.
   They pay back evil for my good
     and leave my soul forlorn.
     Yet, at their illness, I would fast
     and, clad in sackcloth, mourn.

6. And when my prayers went out unheard,
     I mourned as one bereaved
     of mother, brother, closest friend;
     I bowed my head and grieved.
   But when I slipped they gathered round
     and gloated with delight;
     like godless jesters at a feast,
     they gnashed their teeth in spite.

7. O Lord, how long will you look on?
     Defend me from their strife;
     from these marauding lions’ teeth
     protect my precious life.
   Then where the great assembly meets
     to you I will give praise;
     among the crowds of worshippers
     in thanks my voice I’ll raise.

8. Let him not gloat who, without cause,
     is my fierce enemy,
     nor those who hate me unprovoked
     stare spitefully at me.
   They do not speak in peaceful words,
     but cunning schemes have planned,
     accusing those who live at peace
     and quiet in the land.

9. Triumphantly they shout and say,
     “His wickedness we see!”
     Lord, you have seen; hold not your peace.
     Lord, be not far from me.
   Awake, and rise to my defence!
     Contend for me, my God.
     Do not let them gloat over me;
     in justice judge, O Lord.

10. Let them not think within their hearts,
     “At last! Just what we want!”
     Nor let them say, “We’ve swallowed him” –
     let that not be their taunt.
   May all who gloat at my distress
     know shame and loss of face;
     may all who triumph over me
     be covered with disgrace.

11. May those who long to see me cleared
     shout out with joy and sing:
     “The Lord be praised, who loves to see
     his servant prospering.”
   I will extol your righteousness;
     I’ll praise you with my tongue.
     I will proclaim your greatness, Lord,
     and praise you all day long.


Psalm 36  The trespass of the wicked man

1. The trespass of the wicked man
     most plainly testifies
   that fear of God’s most holy name
     is not before his eyes.

2. He views himself with blind conceit,
     his sinfulness denies.
   He speaks with evil and deceit,
     no longer good or wise.

3. In bed he plots his evil ways;
     he schemes throughout the night,
   as he commits himself to sin,
     rejecting what is right.

4. Your steadfast love is great, O Lord;
     it reaches heaven high.
   Your faithfulness is wonderful,
     extending to the sky.

5. Your righteousness is very great,
     like mountains high and steep;
   your justice is like ocean depths.
     Both man and beast you keep.

6. How precious is your steadfast love!
     What confidence it brings!
   Both high and low find shelter in
     the shadow of your wings.

7. They feast within your house, and drink
     from streams of your delight.
   For with you is the source of life;
     in your light we see light.

8. To those who know you as their God,
     your steadfast love impart;
   maintain your righteousness to those
     of pure and upright heart.

9. Let not the ruthless foot of pride
     approach and threaten me,
   nor let the hand of wickedness
     force me to turn and flee.

10. See where these evildoers lie,
     who righteousness despise!
   Thrown down are they, and there they stay,
     unable to arise.


Psalm 37  Do not fret on account of the wicked

1. Do not fret on account of the wicked,
     do not envy the ones who do wrong;
   for like grass they will very soon wither,
     like green plants they will not flourish long.

2. Put your trust in the Lord and be upright;
     then secure in the land you will live.
   Take delight in the Lord above all things –
     the desires of your heart he will give.

3. To the Lord let your way be committed;
     trust in him – he will do what is right.
   Then your justice will shine like the morning,
     your just cause like the sun in its might.

4. So be silent and seek the Lord’s presence,
     and be patient until he replies;
   do not fret when you see the successful,
     if their schemes are promoted through lies.

5. Do not fret – it leads only to evil;
     keep your temper and stay far from wrath,
   for the wicked will certainly perish,
     while the godly inherit the earth.

6. Yet a while, and the wicked will vanish;
     though you search, they will never be found.
   But the land will belong to the humble,
     and their welfare and peace will abound.

7. Though the wicked may strike at the righteous,
     and may gnash their teeth wildly in hate;
   yet the Lord simply laughs at the wicked,
     for he sees the approach of their fate.

8. Though the wicked take aim at the righteous
     and attempt to bring down the oppressed,
   yet their bow will be broken in pieces,
     and their sword will but pierce their own breast.

9. Though the righteous have little, it’s better
     than the riches of many unjust;
   for the wicked’s great strength will be broken,
     but the Lord is the righteous one’s trust.

10. Day by day the Lord cares for the blameless,
     so their heritage stands ever sure.
   When a famine comes, they will have plenty;
     and in drought they will always endure.

11. But the wicked will certainly perish;
     they will vanish, as smoke blows away.
   And the foes of the Lord will be scattered,
     like the flower of the field in a day.

12. The ungodly retain what they borrow,
     but the just give with generous hand.
   For those blest by the Lord will inherit,
     while the cursed are cut off from the land.

13. If the Lord takes delight in a person,
     he will render his steps firm and sure.
   Though he stumble he will not fall headlong,
     for the Lord’s hand will keep him secure.

14. All my life I have not seen the righteous
     left forsaken, or begging for food.
   They are always prepared to lend freely,
     and their children will share what is good.

15. If you turn back from sin and act rightly,
     you’ll continue forever secure;
   for the Lord shows his love to the righteous;
     those who trust him he'll keep safe and sure.

16. The obedient will not be forsaken,
     but the line of the wicked will fail.
   To the righteous the land will be given,
     and forever in it they will dwell.

17. From the mouth of the righteous comes wisdom;
     words of justice proceed from their lips.
   For the law of their God is within them
     and ensures that their foot never slips.

18. The unjust lie in wait for the righteous;
     to destroy them is always their thought.
   But the Lord will not let them be mastered,
     or condemned when to court they are brought.

19. Put your trust in the Lord, I exhort you;
     in his ways you should always remain.
   To inherit the land he’ll exalt you;
     you will see when the wicked are slain.

20. I have witnessed a ruthless man standing
     like a flourishing tree in its ground;
   but he soon passed away and was nothing;
     though I searched, he was not to be found.

21. Watch the blameless, consider the upright;
     there’s a future for those who make peace.
   But destruction awaits the rebellious,
     and their future will suddenly cease.

22. From the Lord comes the hope of the righteous,
     and in trouble defence for the meek;
   so the Lord saves them all from the wicked,
     for in him their protection they seek.


Psalm 38  In wrath do not rebuke me, Lord

1. In wrath do not rebuke me, Lord,
     or in your anger chasten me.
   Your arrows deeply pierce my soul;
     your hand lies on me heavily.

2. Because your anger rests on me,
     my body has no health within;
   there is no soundness in my bones,
     because you judge me for my sin.

3. My guilt has overwhelmed my soul;
     its burden is a crushing weight.
   My wounds are foul and festering,
     because my foolishness is great.

4. I am bowed down, I am brought low,
     and I go mourning all the day.
   My back is filled with searing pain,
     and my whole body wastes away.

5. I’m feeble and completely crushed;
     in anguish of my heart I groan.
   Lord, my desires before you lie;
     to you my sighing is well known.

6. My heart beats wildly, strength has failed,
     the light has faded from my eye.
   My friends and neighbours keep away;
     they see my wounds and then pass by.

7. My enemies who seek my life
     with cunning set their snares for me;
   my foes conspire to do me harm,
     and all day long plot treachery.

8. I’m like the deaf, who cannot hear,
     and like the mute, who cannot cry.
   I’m like a man who hears no sound,
     whose mouth can offer no reply.

9. I wait for you, O Lord my God;
     and you, O Lord, will answer me.
   I prayed to you, “If my foot slips,
     let them not gloat exultantly.”

10. Indeed I am about to fall;
     my pain is ever deep within.
   I must confess iniquity,
     and I am troubled by my sin.

11. My foes are vigorous and strong;
     and many hate me wrongfully.
   My good with evil they repay;
     when I seek good, they slander me.

12. O Lord, do not abandon me;
     do not be far from me, my God.
   Come quickly to deliver me
     because you are my Saviour, Lord.


Psalm 39  I said, “Now let me watch my ways”

1. I said, “Now let me watch my ways
     and keep my tongue from sin.
     I’ll put a muzzle on my mouth
     when I’m with wicked men.”
   When I was silent and kept still
     and firmly held my peace,
     not speaking even what was good,
     this made my pain increase.

2. Because of this my heart grew hot;
     the fire burned strong indeed
     the more I mused upon it all.
     Then I began to plead:
   “Lord, show me that my life will end –
     how many days I’ll see –
     and cause me, Lord, to understand
     how brief my life will be.

3. “O Lord, how short you make my days
     before I sink in death.
     My years are nothing in your sight;
     man’s life is but a breath.
   Like shadows people go about;
     they bustle to and fro.
     They heap up wealth but do not know
     to whom their wealth will go.

4. “But now, what do I look for, Lord?
     My hope is set on you.
     From my transgressions rescue me
     lest fools in scorn pursue.
   I held my peace and would not speak,
     for you did this, I know.
     Remove your scourge from me; your hand
     has struck and laid me low.

5. “For you rebuke and punish men
     for their iniquity.
     You, like a moth, consume their wealth;
     each man is vanity.
   O Lord, please listen to my prayer
     and hear my cry for aid;
     do not be deaf to the appeal
     which I with tears have made.

6. “For as your guest I stay a while.
     I’m like my fathers all –
     a stranger and a pilgrim here.
     Have mercy when I call.
   O turn away your eyes from me.
     Let me rejoice again
     before I finally depart
     and here no more remain.”


Psalm 39b  Teach me the measure of my days

1. Teach me the measure of my days,
     thou Maker of my frame;
   I would survey life’s narrow space,
     and learn how frail I am.

2. A span is all that we can boast;
     how short, how fleet our time!
   Man is but vanity and dust,
     in all his flower and prime.

3. See the vain race of mortals move
     like shadows on the plain:
   they rage and strive, desire and love,
     but all their noise is vain.

4. Some walk in honour’s gaudy show,
     some dig for golden ore;
   they toil for heirs they know not who,
     and straight are seen no more.

5. What should I wish or wait for then,
     from creatures, earth, or dust?
   They make our expectations vain,
     and disappoint our trust.

6. Now I forbid my carnal hope,
     my fond desires recall;
   my mortal interest I give up,
     and make my God my all.


Psalm 40  I waited long upon the Lord

1. I waited long upon the Lord;
     he heard my cry and turned to me.
     He raised me from the slimy pit,
     and from the mire he pulled me free.
   He set my feet on solid rock,
     a place to stand both firm and broad.
   He put a new song in my mouth,
     a joyful hymn of praise to God.

2. Many will look with godly fear
     and on the Lord alone rely.
     Blessed are they who trust the Lord,
     who shun the proud and gods that lie.
   The wonders you have done, O Lord,
     how many and how great they are!
   Your plans for us are far beyond
     our power to number or declare.

3. You did not ask that calves or goats
     be brought as sacrifice for sin,
     but you have opened up my ears;
     you did not seek burnt offering.
   Then I declared, “Lord, I have come;
     it’s written of me in the scroll.
   I want to do your will, my God;
     your law is in my heart and soul.”

4. In the assembly when it met
     your justice I proclaimed abroad.
     I did not seal my lips at all;
     you know all this about me, Lord.
   I did not hide within my heart
     your saving grace and righteousness;
   in the assembly I proclaimed
     your steadfast love and faithfulness.

5. Do not withhold your mercy, Lord;
     surround your servant constantly
     with your great love and faithfulness,
     for many troubles threaten me.
   My sins have overtaken me;
     they’re more than hairs upon my head.
   My heart within me fails for grief;
     I cannot see the way ahead.

6. Be pleased, O Lord, to rescue me;
     O Lord, come quickly to my aid.
     May all who seek to take my life
     with shame and turmoil be repaid.
   May all who plot my overthrow
     turn back, disgraced, the way they came.
   May those who mock me to my face
     become appalled at their own shame.

7. But let all those who seek your face
     be joyful in you all their days;
     let those who love salvation say,
     “Exalted be the Lord always!”
   Yet I am poor and in great need;
     Lord, think on me, I humbly pray.
   You are my saviour and my help;
     come, O my God! Do not delay.


Psalm 41       Blest is the one

1. Blest is the one who cares for those in need;
     the Lord delivers him in times of strife.
   The Lord will surely bless him in the land;
     he will protect him and preserve his life.

2. He will not hand him over to his foes
     that they may satisfy their evil will.
   The Lord will on his sickbed give him help,
     and he will raise him up when he is ill.

3. I said, “Be merciful to me, O Lord;
     heal me, because against you I have sinned.”
   My enemies with malice say of me,
     “When will he die – his name come to an end?”

4. They visit me with falsehood in their hearts
     and then go out and spread their wicked lies.
   Against me all my foes are whispering;
     the worst of fates for me their minds devise.

5. They say, “A vile disease has struck him down;
     he never will get up and leave his bed.”
   My closest friend has turned his back on me –
     my trusted friend, with whom I shared my bread.

6. But you, O Lord, be merciful to me
     and raise me up their malice to repay.
   I know that you are pleased with me, O Lord;
     for over me my foe does not hold sway.

7. In my integrity you hold me fast;
     before you I will constantly remain.
   O praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
     forever and forevermore! Amen.


Psalm 42  As a deer in want of water

1. As a deer in want of water,
     so I long for you, O Lord.
     All my heart and being falter,
     thirsting for your living word.
   When shall I behold your face?
     When shall I receive your grace?
     When shall I, your praises voicing,
     come before you with rejoicing?

2. Bitter tears of lamentation
     are my food by night and day.
     In my deep humiliation
     “Where is now your God?” they say.
   When my sorrows weigh on me,
     then I bring to memory
     how with throngs I would assemble,
     shouting praises in your temple.

3. O my soul, why are you grieving,
     why disquieted in me?
     Put your hope in God, believing
     he will still your refuge be.
   I again shall praise his grace
     for the comfort of his face;
     he will show his help and favour
     for he is my God and Saviour.

4. From the land beyond the Jordan,
     in my grief I think of you;
     from the foothills of Mount Hermon
     I will still remember you.
   As the waters plunge and leap,
     stormy troubles o’er me sweep.
     Day and night God’s song is with me
     as a prayer to him who loves me.

5. I will say to God, my fortress,
     “Why have you forgotten me?
     Why must I proceed in sadness,
     hounded by the enemy?”
   Their rebukes and scoffing words
     pierce my bones like pointed swords,
     as they say with proud defiance,
     “Where is God, your firm reliance?”

6. O my soul, why are you grieving,
     why disquieted in me?
     Put your hope in God, believing
     he will still your refuge be.
   I again shall praise his grace
     for the comfort of his face;
     he will show his help and favour,
     for he is my God and Saviour.


Psalm 42b  As pants the hart

1. As pants the hart for streams of living water,
     so longs my soul, O living God, for thee;
   I thirst for thee, for thee my heart is yearning;
     when shall I come thy gracious face to see?

2. O Lord my God, o’erwhelmed in deep affliction,
     far from thy rest, to thee I lift my soul;
   deep calls to deep and storms of trouble thunder,
     while o’er my head the waves and billows roll.

3. Thou wilt command thy servant’s consolation,
     thy lovingkindness yet shall cheer my day,
   and in the night thy song shall be my comfort;
     God of my life, to thee I still will pray.

4. Why, O my soul, art thou cast down within me?
     Why art thou troubled and oppressed with grief?
   Hope thou in God, the God of thy salvation;
     hope, and thy God will surely send relief.


Psalm 43  Vindicate me, God, my Father

1. Vindicate me, God, my Father,
     come and plead my urgent cause,
     for my enemies forever
     threaten me and flout your laws.
   I am safe with you alone;
     why do you reject your own?
     Lord, I need your help and blessing;
     keep me safe from this oppressing.

2. Send your light and truth to lead me:
     send them forth to be my guide.
     To your mountain let them bring me,
     to the place where you reside.
   Then, O God, I will come near
     and before your throne appear,
     to my Saviour praises bringing
     with the harp and joyful singing.

3. O my soul, why are you grieving,
     why disquieted in me?
     Put your hope in God, believing
     he will still your refuge be.
   I again shall praise his grace
     for the comfort of his face;
     he will show his help and favour,
     for he is my God and Saviour.


Psalm 43b  Come! Vindicate me, O my God!

1. Come! Vindicate me, O my God!
     Against this nation plead my cause!
   Deliver me from wicked foes
     and hypocrites who break your laws.

2. You are my stronghold and my God;
     why then have you rejected me?
   Why must I go about in grief,
     downtrodden by the enemy?

3. O send your light forth and your truth!
     Let them direct me in your grace
   and bring me to your holy hill,
     into your sacred dwelling place.

4. Then to God’s altar I will go,
     to God, my joy and my delight.
   and I will praise you with the harp.
     O God, you are my God of might.

5. Why are you downcast, O my soul?
     Why are you so disturbed in me?
   Trust God, for I will praise him yet;
     my Saviour and my God is he.


Psalm 44  O God, we have heard

1. O God, we have heard and our fathers have told
     what wonders you did in the great days of old.
   The nations were crushed and expelled by your hand;
     you planted our fathers to dwell in the land.

2. They gained not the land by the edge of their sword;
     their own arm to them could no safety afford.
’Twas your arm, your right hand, the light of your face,
     for you showed them favour, your wonderful grace.

3. O God, you alone are forever my King;
     command and for Jacob deliverance bring.
   Through you we will surely put down all our foes;
     through your name we’ll trample on all who oppose.

4. No trust will I place in my sword or my bow,
     for you are my Saviour from hater and foe.
   In God we will boast, for you put them to shame,
     all day and forever we’ll praise your great name.

5. But now you forsake us, to shame bring our boasts;
     no more into battle accompany our hosts.
   You make us turn back from our foe in dismay,
     and these our opponents have made us their prey.

6. You give us like sheep to be slaughtered for food,
     among all the nations dispersed and pursued.
   You sell off your people to strangers for nought;
     their price to your treasury no increase has brought.

7. You make all our neighbours reproach us in pride,
     and cause those around us to scoff and deride.
   The nations revile us and joke at our name;
     they taunt and they threaten; I always know shame.

8. This happened though we had been faithful to you;
     we always have been to your covenant true.
   Our heart has not turned back, our steps have not strayed,
     though made like a ruin and under death’s shade.

9. If we had forgotten the name of our God
     or worshipped an idol, would God then not know?
   for he knows the secrets in everyone’s heart;
     so why do we face death all day for your sake?

10. We’re thought to be destined for slaughter like sheep.
     Awake, O defender! for why do you sleep?
   Rise up! Don’t forget us forever, we plead.
     O why hide your face from our sorrow and need?

11. Our lives are all broken, we’re brought very low;
     our bodies lie crushed on the ground in our woe.
   Rise up! Be our helper! Redeem from the dust,
     because in your covenant mercy we trust.


Psalm 45  A noble theme

1. A noble theme inspires my heart and mind
     as I recite my verses for the king;
   my tongue is like a skilful writer’s pen.
     Of you, most excellent of men, I sing.
   With heavenly grace your lips have been refreshed,
     since God forevermore has made you blest.

2. Your sword, O mighty one, bind on your side,
     and clothe yourself with glorious majesty.
   In royal splendour and in all your strength
     ride forth to battle and to victory
   in aid of truth, humility and right;
     let your right hand display its awesome might.

3. Pierce through with arrows those who hate the king;
     your foes from all the nations trample down.
   Your kingdom’s sceptre will be one of right;
     forevermore, O God, endures your throne.
   Justice you love, iniquity you hate;
     so God above the rest has made you great.

4. With oil of joy he has anointed you;
     with pleasant fragrance all your robes abound.
   From palaces adorned with ivory
     stringed instruments delight you with their sound.
   Among your women royal daughters stand,
     the king’s own bride in gold at your right hand.

5. O daughter, listen and give ear to me;
     forget your people and your father’s house.
   See how your beauty has enthralled the king;
     give honour to your lord and royal spouse.
   People from Tyre will come with gifts to you,
     and wealthy folk your favour will pursue.

6. All glorious is the princess in the court;
     her bridal gown with finest gold is wrought.
   She comes before the king in broidered robes;
     to you the maidens in her train are brought.
   With joy and gladness they are ushered in;
     they come into the palace of the king.

7. Your sons will occupy your fathers’ place,
     and you will make them princes in the land.
   Through all the generations still to come
     I will ensure your memory will stand;
   and therefore all the nations of the earth
     forevermore will celebrate your worth.


Psalm 46  God is our refuge and our strength

1. God is our refuge and our strength,
     our ever present aid,
     and therefore, though the earth be moved,
     we will not be afraid –
   though hills into the seas be cast,
     though foaming waters roar,
     though all the mighty billows shake
     the mountains on the shore.

2. A river flows whose streams make glad
     the city of our God,
     the holy place wherein the Lord
     Most High has his abode.
   Since God is in the midst of her,
     unmoved her walls shall stand;
     for God will hasten to her aid
     when trouble is at hand.

3. The nations rage, the kingdoms move,
     but when his voice is heard,
     earth melts with trembling fear before
     the thunder of his word.
   The Lord of hosts is on our side,
     our safety to secure;
     the God of Jacob is for us
     a refuge strong and sure.

4. O come and see what wondrous works
     the hand of God has done;
     come, see what desolation great
     he brings beneath the sun.
   In every corner of the earth
     he causes wars to cease;
     the weapons of the strong destroyed,
     he makes abiding peace.

5. “Be still and know that I am God,
     o’er all exalted high;
     and every nation of the earth
     my name shall magnify.”
   The Lord of hosts is on our side,
     our safety to secure;
     the God of Jacob is for us
     a refuge strong and sure.


Psalm 47  Clap your hands and shout!

1. Clap your hands and shout! Let your praise ring out!
     Peoples far and near, God Most High revere!
     Awesome King is he, great in majesty.
   Nations he brought low, humbling every foe.
     By his mighty hand he gave us our land –
     sign to Jacob of God’s electing love.

2. God went up on high with a joyful cry,
     and the trumpet’s sound echoed all around.
     Now with loud acclaim magnify his name.
   Play the harp and sing, praise the Lord our King.
     He rules all the earth. Shout his glory forth!
     Let your praise abound. Let the music sound!

3. Glorious is God’s reign, great is his domain.
     He rules all the lands, issues his commands,
     and their princes all gather at his call.
   As his people they Abraham’s God obey,
     for he from his throne claims them as his own.
     Let him be adored as our sovereign Lord!


Psalm 47b  All nations, clap your hands

1. All nations, clap your hands,
     let shouts of triumph ring,
   for mighty over all the lands
     the Lord Most High is King.

2. Above our mighty foes
     he gives us power to stand,
   and as our heritage he chose
     the glorious promised land.

3. With shouts ascends our King,
     with trumpet’s stirring call;
   praise God, praise God, his praises sing,
     for God is Lord of all.

4. O sing in joyful strains,
     and make his glory known;
   God over all the nations reigns,
     and holy is his throne.

5. Our fathers’ God to own
     the kings of earth draw nigh,
   for none can save but God alone;
     he is the Lord Most High.


Psalm 48  Great is the Lord our God

1. Great is the Lord our God, and greatly to be praised.
     Upon a hill God’s city stands in glorious beauty raised –
   his holy mountain high, the city of our King,
     the joy of all the earth below. In praise of God we sing.

2. God makes his city strong by living in her halls.
     When kings join forces and advance, they marvel at her walls.
   They stand and look amazed in terror and alarm;
     as anguish grips like labour pains, they see their certain harm.

3. For just as God destroyed the ships of Tarshish old,
     by east wind shattered, so he crushed those kings who were so bold!
   As in the past we heard, now we have seen it so:
     the city of the Lord of hosts no one can overthrow.

4. Within your temple, Lord, in that most holy place,
     we on your lovingkindness dwell, the wonders of your grace.
   Your people sing your praise where’er your name is known;
     by every deed your hand has worked your righteousness is shown.

5. Let Zion now rejoice and all her daughters sing;
     let them with thankfulness proclaim the judgments of their King.
   Mount Zion’s walls behold, about her ramparts go,
     and number all the lofty towers that guard her from the foe.

6. Observe her palaces, mark her defences well,
     that to the children after you, her glories you may tell.
   For God as our own God forever will abide,
     and till life’s journey close in death will be our faithful guide.


Psalm 49  Listen to me, all you peoples

1. Listen to me, all you peoples,
     all who in the whole world dwell.
     Low and high, both rich and needy,
     hear the message I will tell.
   I will speak with understanding;
     wisdom from the heart I’ll preach.
     I will listen to a proverb;
     secrets with the harp I’ll teach.

2. Why should I fear days of evil,
     when the wicked hem me in –
     those who boast of their possessions?
     By their trust in wealth they sin.
   There is no one who is able
     to redeem a soul from death;
     none can pay to God the ransom
     to prolong another’s breath.

3. To redeem a life is costly –
     none sufficient price can pay
     so that one should live immortal,
     free forever from decay.
   For we all can see life ending;
     wise and foolish, all will die.
     They must leave their wealth to others;
     none can death’s demand defy.

4. So for endless generations
     in their tombs they will remain,
     though they owned, while they were living,
     lands to which they gave their name.
   Man despite his wealth is mortal;
     like the beasts, he fades away.
     Thus the self-assured will perish,
     though renowned for what they say.

5. Death will feed upon their bodies;
     just like sheep they meet their fate.
     In the grave their forms will perish,
     far from where they lived in state.
   But the upright ones will rule them,
     once the morning light has shone.
     From the grave God will redeem me;
     he will take me for his own.

6. Do not quake before a rich man,
     though his fortune grows immense
     and his outward state increases –
     for he will take nothing hence.
   He will soon descend with nothing
     of the splendour he possessed,
     though in life he prospered greatly
     and they told him he was blest.

7. He will go to join his fathers –
     never see the light of day.
     Those with wealth and no discernment
     are like beasts that pass away.


Psalm 50  The mighty God and sovereign Lord

1. The mighty God and sovereign Lord
     has called the earth from sea to sea.
   From Zion’s beauty God shines forth;
     he comes and will not silent be.
   Devouring flame before him goes,
     and dark the tempest round him grows.

2. God summons earth and heav’n above
     to witness how he tries his own:
   “Now gather all my chosen saints,
     who cov-e-nant with me alone.”
   His righteousness the heav’ns declare,
     for God himself is judging there.

3. “Hear, O my people, I will speak;
     against you I will testify.
   Give ear to me, O Israel,
     for God, your faithful God, am I.
   I do not spurn your sacrifice;
     your offerings are before my eyes.

4. “I do not need a goat or bull
     as offering for my holy shrine.
   The cattle on a thousand hills
     and all the forest beasts are mine.
   Each mountain bird to me is known;
     whatever roams the field I own.

5. “If I were hungry, who would know?
     I would not look to you for food.
   The world and all it has is mine;
     I have no need of flesh or blood.
   But pay your vows and call on me;
     then I will set my people free.”

6. But to the wicked, God declares:
     “What right have you to quote my law?
   Why take my covenant on your lips
     when evil you will not withdraw?
   My holy words you make profane;
     you cast them from you in disdain.

7. “You are a scheming friend of thieves,
     of those who break their marriage vows.
   Your tongues speak evil and deceit;
     you slander those within your house.
   You thought that I was just like you,
     that there was nothing I would do!

8. “Consider my rebuke and charge,
     all you who have forgotten me,
   or I will tear you all apart –
     then what deliverance will you see?
   But those who sacrifice with praise
     will always know my boundless grace.”


Psalm 51  O my God, have mercy on me

1. O my God, have mercy on me
     in your steadfast love, I pray;
   in your infinite compassion
     my transgressions wipe away.
   Cleanse me from iniquity;
     wash my sin away from me.

2. For I know my own transgressions;
     I can see my sinful plight.
   I have sinned against you only
     and done evil in your sight.
   So your words are verified,
     and your verdict justified.

3. From my birth I have been sinful –
     such the nature I received –
   sinful from my first beginning
     in my mother’s womb conceived.
   Truth you look for in my heart,
     wisdom to me you impart.

4. Cleanse with hyssop, purify me;
     I’ll be whiter than the snow.
   Let the bones you crushed be joyful;
     may I joy and gladness know.
   From my failure hide your face;
     blot out all my wickedness.

5. Lord, create a pure heart in me,
     and a steadfast mind renew.
   Do not take your Spirit from me;
     cast me not away from you.
   Give me back the joy I had;
     keep my willing spirit glad.

6. Then I’ll teach your ways to sinners;
     rebels will turn back to you.
   Free me from bloodguilt, my Saviour,
     God most merciful and true.
   Then I’ll praise your righteousness;
     teach my lips your name to bless.

7. Sacrifice does not delight you,
     else my tribute I would bring;
   nor do you take any pleasure
     in a whole burnt offering.
   Contrite heart as sacrifice
     you, O God, will not despise.

8. Let your blessing rest on Zion;
     build Jerusalem’s walls again.
   Sacrifices then will please you –
     bulls upon your altar slain,
   offerings made for your delight,
     truly righteous in your sight.


Psalm 51b  God, be merciful to me

1. God, be merciful to me;
     on thy grace I rest my plea.
   Plenteous in compassion thou,
     blot out my transgressions now.
   Wash me, make me pure within;
     cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin.

2. My transgressions I confess;
     grief and guilt my soul oppress.
   I have sinned against thy grace
     and provoked thee to thy face.
   I confess thy judgment just;
     speechless, I thy mercy trust.

3. I am evil, born in sin;
     thou desirest truth within.
   Thou alone my Saviour art;
     teach thy wisdom to my heart.
   Make me pure, thy grace bestow;
     wash me whiter than the snow.

4. Broken, humbled to the dust
     by thy wrath and judgment just,
   let my contrite heart rejoice
     and in gladness hear thy voice.
   From my sins O hide thy face,
     blot them out in boundless grace.

5. Gracious God, my heart renew;
     make my spirit right and true.
   Cast me not away from thee,
     let thy Spirit dwell in me.
   Thy salvation’s joy impart;
     steadfast make my willing heart.

6. Sinners then shall learn from me
     and return, O God, to thee.
   Saviour, all my guilt remove,
     and my tongue shall sing thy love.
   Touch my silent lips, O Lord,
     and my mouth shall praise accord.

7. Not the formal sacrifice
     has acceptance in thine eyes.
   Broken hearts are in thy sight
     more than sacrificial rite;
   contrite spirit, pleading cries,
     thou, O God, wilt not despise.

8. Prosper Zion in thy grace
     and her broken walls replace.
   Then our righteous sacrifice
     shall delight thy holy eyes;
   free-will offerings, gladly made,
     on thine altar shall be laid.


Psalm 52  Mighty mortal, boasting evil

1. Mighty mortal, boasting evil,
     why plot mischief every day?
     Your sharp tongue is like a razor,
     cutting with each word you say.
   You love evil more than goodness,
     harmful words that will devour,
     lying more than speaking truly,
     O you tongue of awful power!

2. God will bring you down to ruin;
     from your place you will be sent.
     In the sight of righteous people
     God will pluck you from your tent.
   Then the righteous, filled with laughter,
     will cry out, “Behold this fool!
     He would not make God his refuge;
     money was his golden rule.”

3. In the house of God I flourish
     like a growing olive tree.
     Trusting in God’s love forever,
     I will praise him thankfully.
   For I know that you have done this;
     I will hope in your good name.
     In the presence of your people
     I your goodness will proclaim.


Psalm 53  The fool speaks in his heart

1. The fool speaks in his heart;
     “There is no God,” he says.
     They are corrupt, their deeds are vile;
     none walk in godly ways.
   The Lord looks down from heav-en
     upon the human race
     to see if any understand,
     if any seek God’s face.

2. They all have turned aside;
     corrupt they have become.
     Not one of them does any good –
     no, not a single one.
   Will sinners never learn?
     My people they’ve devoured
     as if they were consuming bread;
     they never seek the Lord.

3. But see that evil crowd!
     They are struck down with dread,
     although they thought within their hearts
     they would have ease instead.
   The bones of all your foes
     were scattered far abroad;
     and you have put them all to shame;
     they were despised by God.

4. May help from Zion come!
     The Lord his captives bring!
     And then let Jacob’s tribes be glad;
     for joy let Israel sing.


Psalm 54  Save, O God, by your great name

1. Save, O God, by your great name,
     vindicate me, blot out blame.
   Lord, my earnest praying hear,
     to my pleading words give ear.

2. Strangers are attacking me;
     from their violence set me free.
   From their life the Lord they’ve banned,
     but to me God is at hand.

3. God, the Lord, sustains my soul;
     evil deeds back on them roll;
’gainst my foes the Lord defends,
     and my praise to him ascends.

4. I give thanks unto your name;
     it is good beyond all blame.
   God delivered me from grief;
     I now celebrate relief!


Psalm 55  O God, please listen to my prayer

1. O God, please listen to my prayer;
     do not ignore my plea.
   My anxious thoughts make me distraught;
     O hear and answer me.

2. I’m troubled by the voice of foes,
     by their malicious stare;
   for they bring suf-fer-ing to me –
     their hatred I must bear.

3. Within me anguish grips my heart;
     death’s terrors have come near.
   I tremble and am terrified;
     I’m overwhelmed by fear.

4. “O that I, like a dove, had wings!
     Then I would fly away
   and be at rest; I’d flee from here
     and in the desert stay.

5. “Then would I to my hiding-place
     for refuge take my flight,
   far from the raging of the storm
     and from the tempest’s might.”

6. Confuse my enemies, O Lord,
     and all their speech confound;
   for in the city I see strife
     and violence abound.

7. They prowl her walls both day and night;
     abuse and malice meet.
   Destruction is at work, and threats
     and lies are in the street.

8. If enemies insulted me,
     their taunts I could abide;
   or if a foe against me rose,
     then from him I would hide.

9. But it is you, my closest friend,
     a man whom I well know;
   we once enjoyed sweet fellowship,
     as to God’s house we’d go.

10. Let death come on my enemies
     and take them by surprise;
   may they go to the grave alive,
     for evil in them lies.

11. But as for me, I call to God;
     the Lord will save me now.
   At evening, morning and at noon,
     in prayer to him I bow.

12. Distressed, I cry – he hears my voice.
     He ransoms me unharmed
   from battle waged by many foes,
     who are against me armed.

13. My God, enthroned forevermore,
     will hear and will repay
   those men who have no fear of God
     and never change their way.

14. This man attacks his loyal friends
     and breaks his solemn word.
   As smooth as butter is his speech,
     but in his heart’s a sword.

15. O cast your burden on the Lord,
     and he will care for you;
   he’ll never let the righteous fall,
     but bring him safely through.

16. But you, O God, will bring them down –
     those evil, wicked men –
   into the pit of death’s decay
     forever to remain.

17. Bloodthirsty and deceitful men
     will not live half their days;
   but as for me, my confidence
     will rest in you always.


Psalm 56  O God, be merciful

1. O God, be merciful, be merciful to me,
     for man, with constant hate, would love to trample me.
   My many enemies against me proudly fight;
     to overwhelm my soul they watch from morn to night.

2. Whenever I’m afraid, I put my trust in you.
     In God I rest, and praise his word so rich and true.
   In God I put my trust; I neither doubt nor fear;
     what can man do to me with God my helper near?

3. All day they twist my words; their thoughts are full of hate.
     They meet, they lurk, they watch, as for my soul they wait.
   Shall they by wickedness escape your judgment right?
     O God of righteousness, destroy them in your might.

4. You well know all my woes. O bottle all my tears;
     are they not in your book where all my life appears?
   My foes shall backward turn when I to you appeal.
     For this I surely know: that God is for me still.

5. In God, whose word I praise, in him my trust shall be.
     I shall not be afraid; what can man do to me?
   I bring thank offerings for saving me from death;
     before my God I’ll live and walk while I have breath.


Psalm 57  Have mercy on me, Lord

1. Have mercy on me, Lord;
     to you my soul holds fast.
   Your cov’ring wings will shelter me
     until the danger’s past.

2. I cry to God Most High,
     to God who answers me,
   for he fulfils his purposes
     for me most perfectly.

3. He sends his help from heaven
     and saves me from above,
   rebuking those who seek my life;
     God sends his truth and love.

4. I live with savage beasts,
     I dwell with lions strong –
   with men who speak with piercing words;
     a sharp sword is their tongue.

5. Above the highest heavens,
     O God, exalted be!
   And over all the earth below
     display your majesty.

6. My soul was overwhelmed;
     they spread a net for me.
   But they themselves fell in the pit
     which they dug secretly.

7. My heart is steadfast, Lord;
     with music I will sing.
   Awake, my soul! Wake, harp and lyre!
     My song the dawn will bring.

8. Among the nations, Lord,
     to you I will give praise.
   Among the peoples of the earth
     my songs of you I’ll raise.

9. Great is your steadfast love,
     which reaches to the sky.
   Your constant faithfulness, O Lord,
     extends to heaven high.

10. Above the highest heavens,
     O God, exalted be!
   And over all the earth below
     display your majesty.


Psalm 57b  I will give thanks to you

1. I will give thanks to you,
     O Lord, among the people.
     I will sing praises to you among the nations.
   For your steadfast love is great,
     is great to the heavens,
     and your faithfulness, your faithfulness to the clouds.
   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
     Let your glory be over all the earth.
   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
     Let your glory be over all the earth.

2. I will lift your name on high
     in the presence of your people;
     I will praise you to the sky in adoration.
   For your love to me is great,
     greater than the mind can fathom,
     and your faithfulness far beyond what I can tell.
   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
     Let your glory be over all the earth.
   Be exalted, O God, above the heavens.
     Let your glory, let your glory,
     let your glory be over all the earth.


Psalm 58  You rulers, do you know

1. You rulers, do you know what justice is?
     Among mankind do you judge uprightly?
   No, you devise injustice in your hearts,
     and on the earth you mete out cruelty.

2. Even from birth the wicked go astray,
     and from the womb untruthfully they speak;
   their wayward thoughts well up within their hearts,
     and havoc with their lying words they wreak.

3. Their poison’s like the venom of a snake;
     they’re like a cobra that has closed its ear –
   however great the charmer’s skill may be,
     it pays no heed because it does not hear.

4. Destroy, O God, the teeth within their mouths;
     Lord, smite the lion’s jaw a mighty blow.
   Make them disperse as water flows away,
     and blunt their arrows when they draw the bow.

5. May they be like the snail that melts away,
     or like a stillborn child that sees no sun.
   Before a pot can boil on burning thorns,
     so swiftly shall the wicked be undone.

6. The just will tread the blood of wicked men;
     when they’re avenged, the righteous will be glad.
   Then all will say, “The just have their reward;
     surely the judge of all the earth is God.”


Psalm 59  From foes and all who threaten me

1. From foes and all who threaten me,
     O God, be my defence.
     Save me from evildoers’ hands
     and men of violence.
   See how they lie in wait for me!
     Ferocious men combine
     against me, Lord, for no offence
     or sinful deed of mine.

2. I have not done them any wrong,
     yet they prepare to fight.
     Arise to help me in my need;
     take notice of my plight.
   Lord God Almighty, rouse yourself;
     come, God of Israel,
     to judge the nations and spare none
     who wickedly rebel.

3. At evening they return again;
     they snarl like dogs at bay.
     They prowl about the city gates,
     still hungry for their prey.
   See what they spew out from their mouths!
     Look! from their lips come swords!
     With evil mind they laugh and say,
     “Who now can hear our words?”

4. But you, O Lord, will laugh at them;
     those nations you deride.
     I watch for you, my loving God,
     my strength, in whom I hide.
   My God will come and give me help;
     in triumph I will sing
     before all those who slander me,
     O Lord, our shield and king.

5. But lest my people should forget,
     slay not my foes outright.
     Cause them to wander aimlessly;
     defeat them by your might.
   Reward the evil of their lips,
     the words of their own mouths;
     let them be captured by their pride,
     their curses and untruths.

6. Consume them till they are no more;
     in anger lay them low.
     That God rules over Israel
     all distant lands will know.
   At evening they return again;
     like dogs they snarl and growl.
     They roam about the town for food
     and, finding none, they howl.

7. But in the morning I will praise
     your strength and loving care,
     because you are my strong defence,
     my refuge from despair.
   O God, you are my only strength;
     to you I will sing praise.
     You are my fortress and my rock,
     my loving God always.


Psalm 60  O God, you have rejected us

1. O God, you have rejected us
     and torn our dwelling place.
     With quakes and judgments we are fed;
     Lord, save us now in grace.
   Lord, you have set your banners high
     to help your own to stand.
     That your beloved may be saved,
     Lord, help us by your hand.

2. Our God speaks from his holy place:
     “I will give victory.
     For Judah as my scepter rules;
     all lands will bow to me.
   On Edom I will cast my shoe,
     make Gilead my own.
     I use my helmet, Ephraim;
     they all are mine alone.”

3. Now, therefore, who will lead us on
     in triumph on this day?
     Lord, why have you rejected us
     and turned your face away?
   O Lord, we plead, grant us you help
     against our enemy.
     The Lord will tread down all our foes!
     God will give victory!


Psalm 61  O hear my urgent cry, my God

1. O hear my urgent cry, my God,
     and listen to my plea.
   From earth’s remotest bounds I call
     when my heart faints in me.

2. O God, conduct me to the rock
     that’s higher far than I.
   For you’re my refuge from the foe,
     my tower of strength on high.

3. O let me dwell within your tent,
     forever there to live!
   O for the shelter of your wings,
     the refuge which they give!

4. For you have heard my vows, O God,
     and you have given me
   the heritage of those who fear
     your name continually.

5. Prolong the days the king will live;
     his sovereign rule extend
   for many generations more,
     established without end.

6. May he forever sit as king
     enthroned before God’s face;
   appoint your love and faithfulness
     as his protecting grace.

7. Then will I ever bless your name
     with songs of joy and praise,
   and will fulfil my holy vows
     with care throughout my days.


Psalm 62  My soul finds rest in God alone

1. My soul finds rest in God alone;
     from him comes my salvation sure.
   My safety, fortress, sheltering rock –
     in him alone I am secure.

2. How long will you assault a man?
     Do you all seek to lay him low –
   this leaning wall, this tottering fence –
     and bring about his overthrow?

3. They plan his fall from his high place;
     they take delight in spreading lies.
   With false and flatt’ring mouths they bless,
     but in their hearts curse and despise.

4. Find rest, my soul, in God alone;
     in him my hope is ever sure.
   My safety, fortress, sheltering rock –
     in him alone I am secure.

5. My honour and salvation rest
     on God, my rock and mighty fort.
   O people, trust in him always;
     to him alone pour out your heart.

6. The lowborn man is but a breath;
     the highborn man is but a lie.
   Weighed in a balance, side by side,
     they come to nothing but a sigh.

7. Do not seek after wealth by force,
     or triumph in ill-gotten gain;
   and even though your goods increase,
     set not your heart on what is vain.

8. My God has spoken; I have heard
     that you are strong and loving, Lord.
   Each one according to his deeds
     you will assuredly reward.


Psalm 63  O God, you are my God alone

1. O God, you are my God alone;
     I seek your face with eagerness.
   My soul and body thirst for you
     in this dry, weary wilderness.

2. I’ve seen you in your holy place;
     your power and glory held my gaze.
   Far better is your love than life,
     and so my lips will sing your praise.

3. I’ll bless you, Lord, throughout my life
     and raise my hands to you in prayer.
   My joyful lips will sing your praise;
     my soul is fed with richest fare.

4. Upon my bed I lie awake
     and in my thoughts remember you;
   I meditate throughout the night
     and keep your constant love in view.

5. Because you are my help alone,
     in shadow of your wings I’ll sing.
   You hold me up with your right hand;
     to you, O God, my soul will cling.

6. All those who seek my life will die;
     down to the depths they will descend.
   They will become the jackal’s food;
     the deadly sword will bring their end.

7. The king will then rejoice in God,
     with all who swear by God’s great name.
   The mouths of liars will be closed,
     and they will all be put to shame.


Psalm 63b  O Lord, my God, most earnestly

1. O Lord, my God, most earnestly
     my heart would seek thy face,
     within thy holy house once more
     to see thy glorious grace.
   Apart from thee I long and thirst,
     and nought can satisfy;
     I wander in a desert land
     where all the streams are dry.

2. The lovingkindness of my God
     is more than life to me,
     so I will bless thee while I live
     and lift my prayer to thee.
   In thee my soul is satisfied,
     my darkness turns to light,
     and joyful meditations fill
     the watches of the night.

3. My Saviour, ’neath thy sheltering wings
     my soul delights to dwell;
     still closer to thy side I press,
     for near thee all is well.
   My soul shall conquer every foe,
     upholden by thy hand;
     thy people shall rejoice in God,
     thy saints in glory stand.


Psalm 64  Hear my voice, O God

1. Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint;
     guard my life from terror of the foe.
   Hide me from the plots of those who hate,
     from the noisy mob of evil ones.

2. Sharp as swords the wicked whet their tongues
     and like arrows aim their deadly words,
   shoot from ambush at the innocent
     without warning and without a fear.

3. They agree to form an evil plot;
     secretly they talk of laying snares,
   saying, “Who will learn of our designs?”
     They plan carefully their wicked schemes.

4. They are ready with a cunning plot,
     for the human heart is full of guile.
   God will shoot an arrow straight at them;
     without warning they will be struck down.

5. They will all be made to trip themselves
     and undo themselves by their own tongues.
   All who see them shake their heads in scorn;
     then shall all the people fear the Lord.

6. They will ponder God’s almighty deeds
     and proclaim the marvel of his works.
   Let the righteous all rejoice in God;
     praise the Lord for his protecting care!


Psalm 65  Praise is your right, O God, in Zion

1. Praise is your right, O God, in Zion.
     To you we pay our vows.
     When we your people pray, you hear us.
     All flesh to you will bow.
   When our transgressions overwhelm us,
     you graciously forgive.
     How satisfied your chosen servants;
     within your courts they live.

2. Your mighty acts work our salvation.
     All earth waits hopefully.
     You have the strength to make the mountains,
     to calm the stormy sea.
   You calm the tumult of the people.
     Such awesome signs you do
     that earth, from sunrise to the sunset,
     for joy cries out to you.

3. You bless the earth with streams and rivers
     and with the gentle rain.
     You settle ridges, soften furrows.
     and bless the sprouting grain.
   You crown the year with ample harvest;
     a rich abundance springs.
     All flocks and grains and hills and meadows –
     yes, all creation sings.


Psalm 66  Come, everyone, and join with us

1. Come, everyone, and join with us
     in rousing songs of praise.
     Sing out the honour of God's name
     for all his glorious ways.
   Say to our God, “How awesome, Lord,
     are you in all you do.
     Your enemies cringe down in fear,
     then rise to worship you.”

2. O come and see what God has done
     among the sons of men.
     He turned the sea to solid ground –
     let us rejoice in him.
   God rules forever by his might
     and his all-seeing eye.
     Let not the proud, rebellious ones
     exalt themselves on high.

3. Come, everyone, and join with us
     in rousing songs of praise
     to God, who safely holds our lives;
     our feet he guides always.
   O God, you tried and tested us
     as silver tried by flame.
     You brought us low through fire and flood,
     but then your blessing came.

4. With gratitude and of-fer-ings
     I come into your house,
     for when I was in trouble, Lord,
     I spoke to you my vows.
   I bring you now burnt of-fer-ings
     of fatlings from my herd;
     I offer you my gift of thanks,
     because I gave my word.

5. Come, everyone who loves the Lord,
     hear what he did for me.
     My cry for help has turned to praise,
     for he has set me free.
   If in my heart I’d cherished sin,
     God would have turned away.
     But he has listened to my cry;
     he answers when I pray.

6. Praise be to God, who hears my prayer
     and answers my request.
     His steadfast love surrounds my days;
     his name be ever blest.
   Come, everyone, and join with us
     in rousing songs of praise.
     Sing out the honour of God’s name
     for all his glorious ways.


Psalm 67  O God, to us show mercy

1. O God, to us show mercy
     and bless us in your grace,
     and cause to shine upon us
     the brightness of your face,
   so that your way most holy
     on earth may soon be known,
     and unto every people
     your saving grace be shown.

2. Let all the peoples praise you,
     let all the nations sing;
     in every land let praises
     and songs of gladness ring;
   for you will judge the peoples
     in truth and righteousness,
     and on the earth all nations
     will your just rule confess.

3. Let all the peoples praise you,
     let all the nations sing.
     Then earth in rich abundance
     to us her fruit will bring.
   The Lord our God will bless us,
     our God will blessing send,
     and all the earth will fear him
     to its remotest end.


Psalm 68  May God arise

1. May God arise and may his foes
     be scattered far and put to flight.
   As smoke is blown before the wind
     so may your foes be blown from sight.
   As wax is melted by the fire
     may they before God’s wrath expire.

2. But may the righteous all be glad;
     may they rejoice and sing aloud.
   Sing praise to God, sing to his name;
     extol the One who rides the cloud.
   For he alone is named the Lord –
     with joy all praise to him accord.

3. A father to the fatherless,
     of widows’ rights the champion,
   is God within his holy place;
     he gives a home to those forlorn.
   He leads the captives forth with song;
     to rebels barren wastes belong.

4. When you, O God, went out and led
     your people through the desert plain –
   when through the wilderness you marched,
     earth shook and heaven poured down rain
   before the God of Sinai’s hill,
     before the God of Israel.

5. O God, with showers you refreshed
     your heritage so dry and bare.
   And so your people settled down
     and made their habitation there.
   And from your overflowing store
     you made provision for the poor.

6. The Lord announced his sovereign word;
     a mighty crowd took up the shout,
   and many women spread the news:
     “See kings and armies put to rout!
   They leave the fruits of battle’s toil;
     at home the women share the spoil.

7. “Although in open camp you sleep,
     adorned with silver are your wings;
   my dove, your feathers shine like gold.”
     When God Almighty scattered kings,
   the land became like Zalmon steep
     when on its slopes the snow lies deep.

8. See Bashan’s mountains rising high;
     steep and majestic are its hills.
   Why view in envy, rugged heights,
     the hill where God forever dwells?
   The mountain where he chose to reign –
     there will the Lord himself remain.

9. The mighty char-i-ots of God
     in tens of thousands now appear;
   surrounded by unnumbered hosts,
     the Lord himself is drawing near.
   From Sinai he has come to fill
     his sanctu’ry on Zion hill.

10. When you ascended up on high,
     you led out captives after you.
   From people you accepted gifts,
     from those who once were rebels too.
   And so, O Lord God, you have come
     to dwell in Zion as your home.

11. Praise to the Lord, our Saviour God;
     our burdens daily he relieves.
   Of our salvation he is God;
     truly he is the God who saves.
   The Sov’reign Lord defeats the grave;
     he has the power from death to save.

12. The Lord will crush his enemies’ heads,
     the skulls of those who practise sin.
 “From Bashan I will bring them down,
     and from the sea’s depths bring them in,
   that you may plunge your feet in blood,
     which dogs will lick up as their food.”

13. The great procession comes in view –
     the entry of my God and King
   into the holy sanctu’ry.
     Leading them all are those who sing;
   then girls with tambourines appear;
     musicians follow in the rear.

14. In the assembly praise the Lord
     and let God’s praise be heard among
   the gathered tribes of Israel.
     See Judah’s princes in a throng,
   in front the tribe of Benjamin,
     then Naphtali and Zebulun.

15. Summon your glorious power, O God;
     show us the strength at your command,
   as you have done for us of old.
     The kings of earth, from every land,
   will bring their gifts to you in fear,
     and worship at your temple here.

16. Rebuke the beast from Egypt’s reeds,
     the bulls with calves from every land;
   may they with shame their tribute bring.
     Disperse the tribes that war demand.
   Let Egypt’s envoys come to God,
     and Cush bow down before the Lord.

17. O realms of earth, sing to the Lord,
     to him who has his throne on high;
   all kingdoms, join in praise to God,
     whose chariot rides the ancient sky.
   Now listen: he sends out his word,
     a mighty thund’ring voice is heard.

18. Proclaim the mighty power of God,
     whose glory shines on Israel;
   his strength is awesome in the heavens
     and in the place he comes to dwell.
   His people, Israel, God will raise
     to strength and might. To God be praise!


Psalm 68b  O Lord, thou hast ascended

1. O Lord, thou hast ascended
     on high in might to reign;
     captivity thou leadest
     a captive in thy train.
   Rich gifts to thee are offered
     by men who did rebel,
     who pray that now Jehovah
     their God with them may dwell.

2. Blest be the Lord who daily
     our heavy burden bears,
     the God of our salvation,
     who for his people cares.
   Our God is near to help us,
     our God is strong to save;
     the Lord alone is able
     to ransom from the grave.

3. Sing unto God, ye nations,
     ye kingdoms of the earth;
     sing unto God, all people,
     and praise his matchless worth.
   He rides in royal triumph
     upon the heavens abroad;
     he speaks, the mountains tremble
     before the voice of God.

4. All glory, might and honour
     ascribe to God on high;
     his arm protects his people
     who on his power rely.
   Forth from thy holy dwelling
     thine awful glories shine;
     thou strengthenest thy people;
     unending praise be thine.


Psalm 69  Save me, O God; I sink in floods

1. Save me, O God; I sink in floods,
     plunged into misery.
   My constant weeping brings no help;
     Lord, hear and answer me.

2. How countless are my many foes
     who hate without a cause.
   O Lord, you know the wrong I do
     against your holy laws.

3. May those who seek you not be put
     to shame because of me.
   Lord, for your sake I suffer scorn,
     estranged from family.

4. My zeal for your most holy house
     has brought reproach and jest.
   Foes’ vulgar songs about my fate
     leave me the more depressed.

5. In full assurance of your grace
     I turn to you in prayer.
   Deliver me from surging floods;
     draw near, reach out in care.

6. Your steadfast mercy, Lord, is good;
     hide not your face from me.
   Hear my distress and answer, Lord;
     make haste and set me free.

7. You know of my reproach and shame;
     my heart despairs from grief.
   I looked for pity, but I found
     no comfort or relief.

8. They gave me bitter gall for food,
     and vinegar for thirst.
   O may their deeds rebound on them,
     a trap to leave them cursed.

9. In burning anger bring them low,
     desert them, one and all;
   for those chastised by you they taunt.
     O Lord, their crimes recall.

10. Unworthy of salvation’s bliss,
     omit them from your book.
   I am afflicted and in pain;
     grant me your saving look!

11. My song of praise to you, O God,
     is more than sacrifice.
   The Lord still hears the needy ones;
     he heeds the prisoners’ cries.

12. Let heav’n and earth and seas rejoice;
     let all that move give praise.
   All those that love God’s name shall live
     in Zion all their days.


Psalm 69b  Thy lovingkindness, Lord, is good and free

1. Thy lovingkindness, Lord, is good and free;
     in tender mercy turn thou unto me;
   hide not thy face from me in my distress;
     in mercy hear my prayer, thy servant bless.

2. Needy and sorrowful, to thee I cry;
     let thy salvation set my soul on high.
   Then I will sing and praise thy holy name,
     my thankful song thy mercy shall proclaim.

3. With joy the meek shall see my soul restored;
     your heart shall live, ye saints that seek the Lord.
   He helps the needy and regards their cries;
     those in distress the Lord will not despise.

4. Let heav’n above his grace and glory tell,
     let earth and sea and all that in them dwell.
   Salvation to his people God will give,
     and they that love his name with him shall live.


Psalm 70  Make haste, O God, to save me

1. Make haste, O God, to save me;
     O Lord, come to my aid.
     May those who seek to kill me
     be utterly dismayed.
   May all who seek my ruin
     be turned back in disgrace,
     and may all those who mock me
     with shame their steps retrace.

2. But may all those who seek you
     rejoice in you always;
     may those who love salvation
     say, “To our God be praise!”
   Yet I am poor and needy;
     come quickly, God, I pray.
     You are my help and saviour;
     O Lord, do not delay.


Psalm 71  In you, O Lord, I put my trust

1. In you, O Lord, I put my trust;
     shamed let me never be;
     O save me in your righteousness,
     give ear and rescue me.
   O be my rock, my dwelling place,
     where I may always flee;
     for you, my rock and fortress sure,
     save me by your decree.

2. Deliver me from wicked hands,
     save me from men unjust,
     for you, Jehovah, are my hope;
     from youth you are my trust.
   You have upheld me in your grace
     from childhood’s early days;
     to you from whom I life received
     will I give constant praise.

3. Though men around in wonder gaze,
     you are my refuge strong.
     Your praise is what I sing about,
     your glory all day long.
   Don’t cast me off when I grow old –
     when life is almost gone;
     do not forsake me when I’m weak,
     when all my strength is drawn.

4. My foes are strong and confident,
     they talk and make their plans:
     “He is forsaken by his God,
     he’ll fall into our hands.”
   Do not be far, my God, from me;
     make haste to hear my call.
     Ashamed, consumed be all my foes,
     dishonoured let them fall.

5. But I will hope continually,
     and praise you more and more.
     I will declare your righteousness,
     your saving works adore.
   The mighty deeds of God the Lord
     I cannot comprehend;
     but I will praise your righteousness
     until my life shall end.

6. What you have taught in childhood days,
     I, old and grey, tell forth
     to generations coming on,
     your deeds of power and worth.
   Your righteousness is high as heaven.
     Who can compare with you?
     I’ve troubles known, yes, from your hand,
     but you will bear me through.

7. You will restore my life again
     and raise me from the grave.
     With honour great you’ll comfort me,
     when you my soul have saved.
   O Israel’s holy, faithful One,
     with lyre and harp I’ll praise.
     Those who would hurt me you will shame.
     I’ll praise you all my days.


Psalm 72  Endow the king with justice

1. Endow the king with justice, Lord,
     the royal son with righteousness.
     Your people, your afflicted ones,
     he’ll judge with truth and uprightness.
   The mountains will bring peace to them,
     the hills the fruit of righteousness.
     He will defend and save the poor,
     and crush all those who them oppress.

2. As long as sun and moon endure,
     so will he live time without end.
     He’ll be like showers on the earth,
     like rains that on mown fields descend.
   The righteous then will blossom forth
     through out his everlasting reign.
     Until the moon no longer shines,
     peace in abundance will remain.

3. From sea to sea he will hold sway
     and from the river to earth’s end.
     His enemies will lick the dust,
     and desert tribes the knee will bend.
   Then Tarshish and the distant shores
     will send the tribute of their kings,
     Sheba’s and Seba’s kings will come
     and bring to him their offerings.

4. All kings will humbly bow to him,
     and nations worship him with fear.
     He’ll save the needy when they call,
     the poor for whom no help is near.
   He will take pity on the weak
     and save them from oppressive might.
     He’ll rescue them from violence;
     their blood is precious in his sight.

5. Long may he live! May Sheba’s gold
     be giv’n to him abundantly!
     May people ever pray for him
     and bless his name continually.
   Let grain abound throughout the land,
     the tops of hills their harvest yield;
     may they bear fruit like Lebanon
     and thrive as grass grows in the field.

6. Forever may his name endure;
     may it continue as the sun.
     All nations will be blest in him,
     whom they will call the blessed one.
   Praise to the Lord – to Israel’s God;
     his awesome deeds proclaim to men.
     His name be praised eternally,
     his glory fill the earth. Amen!


Psalm 73  Surely God is good to Israel

1. Surely God is good to Israel
     and to those whose hearts are pure.
   As for me, my steps were slipping,
     and my foothold was unsure.
   For the arrogant I envied
     as I saw them live secure.

2. They are not beset by struggles;
     they are healthy, fit and strong –
   undisturbed by such diseases
     as to human life belong.
   So they clothe themselves with violence;
     greed and pride their necks adorn.

3. From their callous hearts comes evil,
     from their minds, great wickedness.
   They deride and speak with malice;
     bold, they threaten to oppress.
   For their mouths lay claim to heaven,
     and their tongues the earth possess.

4. So their people, turning to them,
     praise the wicked to the sky,
   saying, “How can God control us?
     Are we known to God Most High?”
   Thus the wicked grow in riches,
     all anxiety laid by.

5. Have I kept my heart for nothing,
     washed my hands in innocence?
   All day long your plagues are on me;
     daily are my pains intense.
   If I spoke thus, then your children
     would have suffered great offence.

6. When I tried to understand this,
     it was all too hard for me
   till I came into God’s temple –
     then I saw their destiny;
   for on slippery ground you place them
     and destroy them utterly.

7. How they’re shattered in a moment,
     swept away by sudden fear!
   As a dream when one awakens,
     so, O Lord, when you appear,
   you will mock their aspirations,
     and their hopes will disappear.

8. When my spirit was embittered
     and my heart with grief brought low,
   like a beast I was before you –
     dull, in understanding slow.
   Yet, O Lord, you hold my right hand;
     with you I will always go.

9. To your glory you will bring me
     with your counsel as my guide.
   I have none but you in heaven;
     all on earth I lay aside.
   Flesh and heart may fail, but ever
     God my portion will abide.

10. Those far off from you will perish;
     you give them their due reward.
   As for me, it is a blessing
     to be near the Sovereign Lord.
   I have made my God my refuge;
     all your deeds I will record.


Psalm 73b  In doubt and temptation

1. In doubt and temptation I rest, Lord, in thee;
     my hand is in thy hand, thou carest for me.
   My soul with thy counsel through life thou wilt guide,
     and afterward make me in glory abide.

   My God, I will extol thee and ever bless thy name.
   Each day will I give thanks to thee and all thy praise proclaim.

2. In glory thou only my portion shalt be;
     on earth for none other I long but for thee.
   My flesh and heart falter but God is my stay,
     the strength of my spirit, my portion for aye.

   My God, I will extol thee and ever bless thy name.
   Each day will I give thanks to thee and all thy praise proclaim.

3. All they that forsake thee must perish and die,
     but near to my Saviour most blessed am I;
   I make thee my refuge, my Lord and my God;
     thy grace and thy glory I publish abroad.

   My God, I will extol thee and ever bless thy name.
   Each day will I give thanks to thee and all thy praise proclaim.


Psalm 73c  In sweet communion, Lord, with thee

1. In sweet communion, Lord, with thee
     I constantly abide;
   my hand thou holdest in thine own
     to keep me near thy side.

2. Thy counsel through my earthly way
     shall guide me and control,
   and then to glory afterward
     thou wilt receive my soul.

3. Whom have I, Lord, in heav’n but thee,
     to whom my thoughts aspire?
   And, having thee, on earth is nought
     that I can yet desire.

4. Though flesh and heart should faint and fail,
     the Lord will ever be
   the strength and portion of my heart,
     my God eternally.

5. To live apart from God is death,
     ‘tis good his face to seek;
   my refuge is the living God,
     his praise I long to speak.


Psalm 74  O God, why have you cast us off?

1. O God, why have you cast us off forever?
     Why rage against the sheep within your fold?
   Do not forget the people whom you purchased,
     the heritage which you redeemed of old.

2. Remember where you dwelt upon Mount Zion,
     and turn your steps toward these ruined walls –
   all this destruction which the foe in malice
     has perpetrated on your sacred halls.

3. Your enemies have roared in your assembly;
     their standards fly victorious in the breeze.
   Their fury was like woodmen wielding axes
     to cut through undergrowth between the trees.

4. They smashed to pieces all the fretted woodwork –
     with axe and hatchet every panelled frame.
   They burned you holy sanctu’ry to ashes,
     and made unclean the place where dwells your Name.

5. Their thought was, “We will utterly destroy them!”
     They burned each place of worship in the land.
   We see no miracles; there are no prophets,
     and no one knows when all these things will end.

6. How long, O God, will enemies revile you?
     Forever will your foes blaspheme and scoff?
   Why do you keep your right hand hidden from us?
     Stretch it against your foes and cut them off!

7. But from of old, O God, you are my sovereign;
     upon the earth you win the victory.
   You split apart the ocean by your power;
     you broke the monsters’ heads within the sea.

8. The heads of great Leviathan were shattered;
     you gave him to the desert beasts to eat.
   You were the one who opened streams and fountains;
     you dried the rivers in the summer’s heat.

9. The day is yours; yours also is the night-time;
     the sun and moon were put in place by you.
   You set the limits of the earth by wisdom;
     you made the summer and the winter too.

10. Remember how the enemy reviles you,
     how foolish people never cease to mock.
   Leave not your loved one for the beasts to savage;
     do not abandon your afflicted flock.

11. Regard, O Lord, your covenant with your people,
     for haunts of violence fill the land with shame.
   Let not defeat bring scorn on the downtrodden;
     may yet the poor and needy praise your name.

12. Rise up, O God, defend your cause in judgment;
     remember how fools mock you all the day.
   Do not ignore the clamour of your enemies;
     their hostile roaring never goes away.


Psalm 75  We give you thanks, O God

1. We give you thanks, O God,
     because your name is near.
   All speak of your majestic deeds;
     your voice we also hear:

2. “I choose the appointed time;
     I judge with justice sure.
   When earth and all its people quake,
     its pillars I secure.

3. “ ‘Boast not!’ I tell the proud;
     the wicked I address:
‘Do not lift up your heads with pride
     or speak with haughtiness.’ ”

4. No one in all the earth
     can truly give renown.
   God is the judge; he raises one
     and puts another down.

5. The Lord’s hand holds a cup
     with wine of powerful blend;
   he pours it out, and wicked ones
     must drink it to the end.

6. God’s works I will proclaim,
     and Jacob’s God I’ll praise.
   The wicked’s strength I will destroy;
     the righteous I will raise.


Psalm 76  God is known among his people

1. God is known among his people;
     every mouth his praises fill.
   From of old he has established
     his abode on Zion's hill.
   There he broke the sword and arrow,
     bade the noise of war be still.

2. Excellent and glorious art thou,
     with thy trophies from the fray.
   Thou hast slain the valiant-hearted;
     wrapt in sleep of death are they.
   When thine anger once is risen,
     who can stand in that dread day?

3. When from heaven thy sentence sounded,
     all the earth in fear was still,
   while to save the meek and lowly
     God in judgment wrought his will.
   E’en the wrath of man shall praise thee;
     thy designs it shall fulfil.

4. Vow and pay ye to Jehovah;
     him your God forever own;
   all men, bring your gifts before him;
     worship him, and him alone.
   Mighty kings obey and fear him;
     princes bow before his throne.


Psalm 77  I cry out to God to hear me

1. I cry out that God may hear me,
     and with help be ever near me.
     To the Lord I cry aloud,
     by a weight of trouble bowed.
   I stretch out my hands to reach him;
     all the night my prayers beseech him.
     To my God my grief I told;
     I refused to be consoled.

2. I remember God with weeping;
     you have kept my eyes from sleeping.
     I recall the days of light,
     days when songs came in the night.
   Will the Lord reject forever?
     Will he show his favour never?
     Will his promise not prevail;
     mercy, in his anger, fail?

3. So his wonders I remember;
     years of his right hand I ponder,
     think on his great deeds so bold –
     all his miracles of old.
   For your ways, O God, are holy;
     matchlessly they show your glory –
     mighty miracles that save
     all your people from the grave.

4. Waters lifted in convulsion
     for the Lord of all creation,
     pouring rain from clouds on high;
     flashing arrows fill the sky.
   Hear your thunder in the whirlwind;
     through the sea, your footprints, hidden.
     So your flock by Moses’ hand,
     safe, you led into your land.


Psalm 78  O my people, hear my teaching

1. O my people, hear my teaching;
     parables I will unfold.
   Give attention as I utter
     dark and hidden things of old –
   things that we have heard and known;
     by our fathers they were shown.

2. We will tell them to our children,
     generations yet to come;
   we will show the Lord’s great power
     and the wonders he has done.
   Laws for Israèl he made,
     statutes firm to be obeyed.

3. These he ordered our forefathers
     to their families to tell,
   so the coming generation,
     not yet born, would know them well,
   and their children, in their turn,
     God’s commands and laws would learn.

4. Then to God they would be faithful,
     mindful of what he had done –
   not like their disloyal fathers,
     stubborn rebels every one;
   for God’s word they had denied
     and his precepts they defied.

5. Such were those of Ephraim’s army
     who, though strong and armed with bows,
   to the covenant were disloyal,
     turned their back upon their foes.
   They forgot what God had done
     and the wonders he had shown.

6. He showed wonders to their fathers
     while they were in Egypt’s land –
   split the sea and led them through it,
     waters heaped on either hand.
   With the cloud he led by day;
     fire by night revealed their way.

7. In the desert God brought water
     from the rock to quench their thirst –
   waters brimming like the ocean,
     streams from rocky crags that burst.
   But they always would defy
     and reject him, God Most High.

8. They provoked God in the desert:
     “Can he satisfy our taste?
   When he struck the rock, it opened,
     down the crag the waters raced.
   Now our thirst is satisfied,
     can he food for us provide?”

9. When the Lord heard, he was angry,
     and his wrath broke out like fire;
   Jacob knew his fierce displeasure,
     Israèl his righteous ire.
   Faith in God they cast aside
     and his saving power denied.

10. To the skies he gave the order;
     heaven’s doors he opened wide.
   Manna rained down for his people;
     grain of heaven he supplied.
   Angels’ bread lay at their feet;
     they had all that they could eat.

11. From the heav’ns he loosed the east wind,
     led the south wind forth with power.
   Meat, like dust, he rained upon them,
     birds like sand upon the shore.
   In the camp came down the quail,
     all around their tents like hail.

12. Thus in gluttony they feasted,
     for he gave them their desire.
   But, before they finished eating,
     God’s displeasure blazed like fire.
   So their stoutest warriors fell,
     and the youth of Israèl.

13. Still they disbelieved his wonders,
     kept on sinning nonetheless.
   So he closed their days in terror
     and their years in emptiness.
   When he punished them, they turned,
     and with zeal for him they burned.

14. God their Rock they then remembered,
     their Redeemer, God Most High;
   but their words were meant to flatter,
     what they told him was a lie.
   In their hearts they were untrue;
     from his covenant they withdrew.

15. Yet in mercy he forgave them;
     from destruction he refrained.
   Many times he curbed his anger
     and his utmost wrath restrained.
   That they were but flesh, he knew –
     like a passing breeze that blew.

16. How they grieved him in the desert,
     ever ready to rebel –
   vexed the Holy One and tested
     the great God of Israèl!
   They forgot his wonders shown
     to them in the fields of Zoan.

17. They forgot his signs in Egypt,
     when from hardship they were saved,
   when to blood he turned its river,
     making foul the drink they craved.
   God sent swarms of flies to bite,
     hordes of frogs their land to blight.

18. He gave Egypt’s crops to locusts,
     and the swarms ate all their store.
   Freezing rain destroyed their fig trees,
     and the hail their vineyards tore.
   Hailstones battered all their stock;
     lightning bolts their cattle struck.

19. Egypt felt his indignation,
     dread hostility and wrath.
   By his angels of destruction
     for his rage he made a path.
   E’en from death he did not spare;
     mortal plague he made them bear.

20. All the firstborn sons of Egypt
     in the tents of Ham he struck.
   But from there he led his people
     through the desert like a flock.
   Fearless, they were safely led;
     in the sea their foes lay dead.

21. To his holy land he brought them,
     to the hills seized by his hand;
   He drove nations out before them
     and assigned to them their land,
   where, as their inheritance,
     Israel’s tribes found residence.

22. But once more their God they tested,
     spurning God Most High anew.
   They were faithless like their fathers,
     like a faulty bow, untrue.
   Their high places stirred his ire;
     their false gods his jealous fire.

23. When God heard them, he was angry;
     he abandoned Israèl.
   He forsook the tent of Shiloh,
     where he vowed with them to dwell,
   sent his glory far away,
     gave his ark with foes to stay.

24. Angry, he forsook his people,
     slew his own inheritance.
   Fire consumed their choice young manhood;
     maidens had no wedding dance.
   Priests lay slaughtered by the sword;
     widows could not speak a word.

25. Then the Lord awoke from slumber,
     as a man with wine replete
   wakes recovered from his stupor.
     Then he made his foes retreat;
   like a rabble they became,
     put to everlasting shame.

26. He passed by the tents of Joseph
     and the tribe of Ephraim;
   but he chose the tribe of Judah,
     and Mount Zion, loved by him.
   There he built his dwelling sure,
     like the earth, to stand secure.

27. So he chose his servant David,
     bringing him from tending sheep,
   to be shepherd of his people,
     God’s inheritance to keep.
   Faithfully by David fed,
     they with skilful hands were led.


Psalm 78b  Let children hear the mighty deeds

1. Let children hear the mighty deeds
     which God performed of old,
     which in our younger years we saw
     and which our fathers told.
   He bids us make his glories known,
     the works of power and grace,
     that we convey his wonders down
     through every rising race.

2. Our lips shall tell them to our sons,
     and they again to theirs;
     and generations yet unborn
     must teach them to their heirs;
   thus shall they learn, in God alone
     their hope securely stands,
     that they may not forget his works,
     but honour his commands.


Psalm 79  Lord, the nations have invaded

1. Lord, the nations have invaded
     and attacked your heritage;
     they defiled your holy temple –
     crushed Jerusalem in a rage.
   They have given your saints’ bodies
     to the birds of prey as meat,
     and the corpses of your servants
     to wild animals to eat.

2. They have poured out blood like water
     all around Jerusalem –
     bodies everywhere, and no one
     to give burial to them.
   We are objects of derision
     to the neighbours of our land;
     scorn, reproach and degradation
     circle us on every hand.

3. Lord, how long?  Will your displeasure
     still run on and never tire?
     How long will your jealous anger
     burn like all consuming fire?
   Pour your fury on the nations
     that refuse to seek your face;
     for they have uprooted Jacob
     and destroyed his dwelling place.

4. Charge us not with the transgressions
     of our forebears long ago;
     may your mercy come to meet us –
     you have brought us very low.
   Help us, Lord, our God and Saviour,
     for the glory of your name.
     For your name’s sake come and save us;
     take away our sin and shame.

5. Why should the surrounding nations
     say to us, “Where is your God?”
     Make the peoples know your vengeance
     for your servants’ outpoured blood.
   May the groans of every pris’ner
     come before your throne on high;
     by your arm outstretched in power
     save all those condemned to die.

6. Lord, remember how our neighbours
     treat you with contempt and scorn;
     and into their laps deliver
     sevenfold judgment in return.
   Then shall we, the sheep you pasture,
     worship and adore your name,
     and through every generation
     your unending praise proclaim.


Psalm 80  Hear, O Israel’s Shepherd

1. Hear, O Israel’s Shepherd, hear us;
     Joseph like a flock you lead.
   You who are enthroned in glory,
     shine upon us in our need.

2. Shine on Benjamin, Manasseh,
     and for Ephraim rouse your might!
   Turn us once again toward you;
     come and save us, give us light!

3. O Lord God, the Lord Almighty,
     all our prayers you do not hear.
   How long will your anger smoulder
     and our enemies still jeer?

4. You have fed us bread of sorrow;
     tears in plenty we must shed.
   We are now before our neighbours
     humbled and discredited.

5. Look on us, O God Almighty;
     let us see your glory bright.
   Turn us once again toward you;
     come and save us, give us light!

6. Once you brought a vine from Egypt,
     drove out kings with mighty hand,
   set the vine in ground made ready;
     it took root and filled the land.

7. So its branches clothed the mountains,
     shading every cedar tree,
   spreading from the great Euphrates
     to the mighty western Sea.

8. Why did you break down its fences,
     so that all may pluck its fruit?
   Creatures of the field devour it;
     wild boars tear it from the root.

9. Turn to us, O God Almighty,
     look and see from heav’n above!
   Tend this vine your hand has planted
     and the son you raised in love.

10. See your vine cut down and withered,
     and its branches burned with fire;
   your rebuke has crushed your people,
     and they perish in your ire.

11. Let your hand be placed in blessing
     on the man at your right hand –
   on the son of man you’ve chosen,
     whom alone you caused to stand.

12. Then we will not wander from you,
     turning from you to our shame.
   Strengthen us, revive and heal us;
     then we’ll call upon your name.

13. Look on us, Lord God Almighty;
     let us see your glory bright
   Turn us once again toward you;
     come and save us, give us light!


Psalm 81  Sing for joy to God

1. Sing for joy to God our Saviour,
     shout aloud to Jacob’s Lord!
     Start the music, strike the timbrel;
     play on strings a pleasing chord.
   Sound the trumpet at the New Moon,
     at the full moon sound again,
     at the feast which God appointed
     and for Israel did ordain.

2. God ordained the law for Joseph
     when he ravaged Egypt’s land.
     There we listened to a language
     which we did not understand.
   He said: “I removed the burden
     and their aching hands set free.
     I delivered you from trouble
     when you called for help to me.

3. “From the thundercloud of Sinai
     all you people I addressed;
     when at Meribah you murmured,
     there I put you to the test.
   Hear, my people, let me warn you –
     if you would but listen now!
     No strange god shall be among you;
     to a false god do not bow.

4. “I, who brought you up from Egypt,
     your own God, the Lord, am I;
     open wide your mouth toward me;
     and your food I will supply.
   But my people would not listen –
     would not do what I required.
     So I gave them up to follow
     what their stubborn hearts desired.

5. “If my people would but heed me,
     Israel follow my command,
     I would soon subdue their enemies,
     and against them turn my hand.
   Those who hate the Lord would cower,
     and their doom would never end.
     But with finest wheat I’d feed you,
     honey from the rock I’d send.”


Psalm 82  There where the judges gather

1. There where the judges gather,
     a greater takes his seat;
     “How long,” he asks the judges,
     “will you pronounce deceit?
   How long show special favour
     to those of ill repute?
     How long neglect the orphaned,
     the poor and destitute?

2. “Deal justly with the needy,
     protect the fatherless,
     deliver the afflicted
     from those who would oppress.
   But you are wholly blinded,
     you do not understand;
     therefore foundations totter,
     injustice rocks the land.”

3. God speaks: “I named you rulers,
     sons of the Most High God;
     but you shall die as mortals
     and perish by my rod.”
   Arise, O God, in judgment,
     your sovereignty make known;
     for yours are all the nations,
     the peoples are your own.


Psalm 83  O my God, do not keep silent

1. O my God, do not keep silent;
     be not quiet, be not still.
     See how all your foes are stirring,
     eager to move in and kill.
   For they plot against your loved ones,
     make their cunning plans, and say,
     “Come, let us destroy their nation;
     Israel’s name we’ll sweep away.”

2. With one mind they plot against you;
     they are allies for the fight –
     tents of Hagar and of Moab,
     Edom and the Ishmaelite,
   Gebal, Amalek and Ammon,
     Philistines with men of Tyre.
     Now Assyria has joined them;
     Lot’s descendants strength acquire.

3. Deal to them as once to Midian;
     Jabin, Sisera once slain
     at the mighty torrent Kishon,
     left like refuse in the rain.
   Make their chiefs like Zeeb and Oreb,
     Zeba and Zalmunna too,
     when they said, “We’ll take possession
     of God’s pasturelands from you.”

4. Like the tumbleweed disperse them,
     like the chaff before the breeze.
     As the flames lay waste the mountains
     or the fire consumes the trees,
   so pursue them with your tempest;
     may your storm bring fear and shame.
     Lord, bring them humiliation,
     so that they may seek your name.

5. May they be ashamed forever;
     let dismay be on their face.
     May they be destroyed completely;
     let them perish in disgrace.
   Lord, make known your name among them;
     show that you alone are God –
     that you are the Most High, ruling
     over all the earth abroad.


Psalm 84  O Lord of hosts, how lovely

1. O Lord of hosts, how lovely
     thy tabernacles are;
     for them my heart is yearning
     in banishment afar.
   My soul is longing, fainting,
     thy sacred courts to see;
     my heart and flesh are crying,
     O living God, for thee.

2. Beneath thy care the sparrow
     finds place for peaceful rest;
     to keep her young in safety
     the swallow finds a nest;
   then, Lord, my King Almighty,
     thy love will shelter me;
     beside thy holy altar
     my dwelling place shall be.

3. Blest they who dwell in Zion,
     whose joy and strength thou art;
     forever they will praise thee,
     thy ways are in their heart.
   Though tried, their tears like showers
     shall fill the springs of peace,
     and all the way to Zion
     their strength shall still increase.

4. Lord God of hosts, in mercy
     my supplication hear;
     almighty and all-faithful,
     our fathers’ God, give ear.
   Our shield and great defender,
     no longer hide thy face,
     but look upon thy servant,
     anointed by thy grace.

5. In thy blest courts to worship,
     my God, a single day
     is better than a thousand
     while far from thee I stray.
   Though in a lowly station,
     the service of my Lord
     I choose above all pleasures
     that sinful ways afford.

6. A sun and shield forever
     is God, the Lord Most High;
     to those who walk uprightly
     no good will he deny.
   His saints, his grace receiving,
     shall soon his glory see;
     O Lord of hosts, most blessed
     are they that trust in thee.


Psalm 85  In times past, Lord

1. In times past, Lord, you showed favour
     to your own beloved land;
     the prosperity of Jacob
     you restored by your strong hand.
   You forgave your people's trespass;
     you were pleased their sins to hide.
     You withdrew all your displeasure;
     from your wrath you turned aside.

2. God our Saviour, now restore us;
     from us turn away your rage.
     Will your anger burn against us?
     Will it last from age to age?
   Will you not again revive us,
     that we may rejoice in you?
     Show us, Lord, your covenant mercy;
     your salvation grant anew.

3. I will hear what God the Lord says:
     to his saints he offers peace;
     but his people must not wander
     and return to foolishness.
   Surely for all those who fear him
     his salvation is at hand,
     so that once again his glory
     may be seen within our land.

4. Love and truth have met together;
     righteousness and peace embrace.
     Righteousness looks down from heaven;
     from the earth springs faithfulness.
   What is good the Lord will give us,
     and our land its fruit will bear.
     Righteousness will go before him
     and his royal way prepare.


Psalm 86  Hear, O Lord, and answer me

1. Hear, O Lord, and answer me;
     I am poor, and needy too.
     Guard my life; save me, my God,
     for your servant trusts in you.
   Lord, be merciful to me;
     all day long to you I call.
     Give your servant joy, O Lord,
     for to you I lift my soul.

2. You, O Lord, alone are good;
     you are ready to forgive.
     To all those who call on you,
     you abound in steadfast love.
   Hear my earnest prayer, O Lord;
     listen to my troubled cry.
     In distress I’ll call on you,
     for in mercy you’ll reply.

3. Lord, among the many gods
     there is none to rival you;
     deeds that others may perform
     never match what you can do.
   Lord, the nations you have made
     will come near and praise your name.
     You alone are God; your deeds
     bring to you outstanding fame.

4. Teach me, Lord, your way, that I
     from your truth may not depart;
     so that I may fear your name,
     give me a devoted heart.
   Lord, with all my heart I will
     praise your name unceasingly.
     For your love to me is great;
     from the grave you rescued me.

5. Proud men are attacking me;
     and the ruthless men of strife,
     who have no regard for God,
     seek to take away my life.
   But, Lord, you are merciful,
     God of grace and tenderness,
     slow to anger, rich in love
     and in covenant faithfulness.

6. Turn your face to-wards me, Lord,
     and to me compassion show.
     Give me strength and save my life;
     on your servant grace bestow.
   Grant a sign of favour, Lord,
     which my enemies may see;
     then they will be put to shame,
     for you help and comfort me.


Psalm 86b  Lord, my petition heed

1. Lord, my petition heed,
     now help me in my need,
     or else I die.
   I am your servant, Lord;
     my trust is in your word.
     Mercy to me accord;
     to you I cry.

2. Comfort your servant now,
     while at your throne I bow
     and call to you.
   Your pard’ning grace is free;
     sinners who raise their plea
     your love and mercy see;
     they are made new.

3. Lord, hear me when I pray,
     in every troubled day
     I seek your face.
   O Lord, you far outshine
     the gods of our design;
     matchless your deeds divine,
     O God of grace.

4. By nations you have made,
     your praise will be displayed
     through earth abroad.
   Your name be glorified,
     your greatness magnified;
     wondrous your works abide,
     for you are God!

5. To me your truth impart,
     so that with all my heart
     I fear your name.
   I will give thanks to you,
     your praise I will pursue;
     all glory be to you,
     O Lord my God!

6. Great is your love to me;
     from death you set me free
     when foes alarm.
   Your grace I surely know;
     your anger, Lord. is slow;
     your lovingkindness show;
     save me from harm.

7. Show me your mercy true,
     your servant’s strength renew,
     salvation send.
   A sign of favour show;
     your comfort, Lord, bestow;
     let those who hate me know
     you are my friend.


Psalm 87  On the holy mountain

1. On the holy mountain the Lord laid his foundation.
     He loves the gates of Zion far above
     all the dwelling places in all of Jacob's nation.
   Glo-ri-ous praise is yours, O city of the Lord.
     Tyre and Ethiopia and also Babylon,
     Rahab and Philistia in Zion born, in Zion born!

2. Zion, blessed Zion, by God Most High established,
     they say this one and that in her were born.
     There will be salvation for every tribe and nation,
   for the Lord shall count them all his very own.
     Flutes and instruments will lead the throng and they will sing,
     “All my founts of joyful praise from Zion spring, from Zion spring!”


Psalm 88  Lord, you are the God who saves me

1. Lord, you are the God who saves me;
     I entreat you night and day.
   May my pleading come before you;
     turn your ear to me, I pray.

2. For my soul is full of trouble,
     and my life draws near to death.
   Counted with the ones who perish,
     I have neither strength nor breath.

3. To the grave I am abandoned,
     like the bodies lying there.
   You remember them no longer;
     they are cut off from your care.

4. In the lowest pit you cast me;
     in the darkest depths am I.
   For your wrath is heavy on me,
     and beneath your waves I lie,

5. Closest friends you’ve taken from me;
     loathsome to them is my plight.
   I am trapped – escape I cannot;
     misery has dimmed my sight.

6. Daily, Lord, I call upon you;
     in your sight my hands I spread.
   In the grave do you show wonders?
     Are you worshipped by the dead?

7. Is your love shown in Destruction –
     in the grave your faithfulness?
   Are your wonders known in darkness,
     or in death your righteousness?

8. But I cry to you for help, Lord;
     at the dawn to you I pray.
   Why, O Lord, do you reject me,
     and why turn your face away?

9. From my youth I’ve been afflicted;
     death to me is always near.
   I have undergone your terrors,
     and I am in deep despair.

10. Your fierce anger has engulfed me;
     by your terrors I am crushed.
   All day long they overwhelm me;
     over me the flood has rushed.

11. You have taken my companions
     and my loved ones far from me.
   Now my closest friend is darkness;
     not a ray of light I see.


Psalm 89 Part 1  I will extol the Lord’s great love

1. I will extol the Lord’s great love forever;
     your faithfulness to all I will proclaim.
   I will declare your love stands firm forever;
     your faithfulness in heaven you maintain.

2. You said, “I made a covenant with my chosen,
     and to my servant David I have sworn:
‘I will ensure your line will last forever,
     your throne to generations yet unborn.’ ”

3. O Lord, the heavens praise your mighty wonders
     and to your saints your faithfulness declare.
   For who is like the Lord among the angels,
     or who in heaven can with him compare?

4. For God is feared within his holy council,
     more awesome than the angels all around.
   O God, the Lord Almighty, who is like you
     whom such great might and faithfulness surround?

5. O Lord, your rule controls the surging ocean;
     you still the raging waves upon the seas.
   Rahab you crushed to death with your great power;
     with your strong arm you rout your enemies.

6. The earth is yours, to you belong the heavens;
     you made the world and everything therein.
   By you the north and south were both created;
     Tabor and Hermon praise your name and sing.

7. Your arm, O Lord, is filled with mighty power;
     your hand is strong, exalted high above.
   Your throne is built on righteousness and justice;
     in front of you go faithfulness and love.

8. How blest are those who learn to sing your praises,
     who walk before you in your light, O Lord!
   All day in your great name they are rejoicing;
     they praise your righteousness with one accord.

9. For you, Lord, are your people’s strength and glory,
     and honour to our sov-er-eign you bring.
   Indeed, from God the Lord comes our protection;
     to Israel’s Holy One belongs our king.


Psalm 89 Part 2  There was a time

10. There was a time you told us in a vision;
     this to your faithful people you made known:
   “I have bestowed my strength upon a warrior,
     a young man whom I raise up to the throne.

11. “I have sought out my faithful servant, David;
     I have anointed him with sacred oil.
   My hand will surely strengthen and sustain him;
     my arm will give him pow-er for his toil.

12. “No enemy will force him to pay tribute;
     no wicked one will ever bring him low.
   For I will crush his enemies before him;
     I will annihilate his every foe.

13. “My faithful love will be with him forever;
     his pow’r will be exalted through my name.
   His right hand I will set above the rivers;
     his rule upon the sea I will proclaim.

14. “He will declare to me, ‘You are my Father,
     you are my rock, my saviour and my God.’
   As my firstborn I also will appoint him,
     supreme among all kings on earth abroad.

15. “I will maintain my love to him forever;
     my cov-e-nant with him will never fail.
   His line forevermore I will establish;
     while heaven lasts, his kingdom will prevail.

16. “But if his sons forsake my laws and statutes
     and violate my cov-e-nant command,
   I’ll punish with the rod all their transgression,
     their sin with blows inflicted by my hand.

17. “But I will never take my love from David;
     my faithfulness I never will betray.
   Nor will I ever violate my covenant
     or alter what I said in any way.

18. “Once have I sworn in holiness to David –
     I will not lie to him – I will declare
   that David’s line forever will continue,
     and on his throne he’ll always have an heir.

19. “His throne will ever flourish in my presence;
     it will continue like the sun on high.
   I’ll make it certain, like the moon in heaven,
     which is a faithful witness in the sky.”


Psalm 89 Part 3  But you, O Lord, have spurned

20. But you, O Lord, have spurned, you have rejected,
     you have been angry with your chosen one.
   You have renounced the covenant with your servant,
     and in the dust you have defiled his crown.

21. For you have broken all his walls in pieces;
     his strongholds down to ruin you have torn.
   All passers-by have plundered his possessions;
     he is the object of his neighbours’ scorn.

22. The right hand of his foes you have exalted;
     his enemies rejoice with one accord.
   You gave him no support in time of battle;
     instead you blunted and turned back his sword.

23. Now you have put an end to all his splendour,
     and you have cast his throne upon the ground.
   You have cut short his days of youthful vigour,
     and with a cloak of shame he’s wrapped around.

24. How long, Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?
     How long will your fierce anger on us fall?
   Remember that my life is swift and fleeting.
     For what futility you made us all!

25. For who can live and be secure from dying,
     or who resist the pow-er of the grave?
   O Lord, where is your former love for David,
     whom in your faithfulness you swore to save?

26. Remember, Lord, how they have mocked your servant,
     how in my heart I bear the taunts of men;
   your foes have mocked and scorned the Lord’s anointed.
     But ever let the Lord be praised! Amen.


Psalm 89b  Almighty God, thy lofty throne

1. Almighty God, thy lofty throne
     has justice for its cornerstone,
   and shining bright before thy face
     are truth and love and boundless grace.

2. With blessing is the nation crowned
     whose people know the joyful sound;
   they in the light, O Lord, shall live,
     the light thy face and favour give.

3. Thy name with gladness they confess,
     exalted in thy righteousness;
   their fame and might to thee belong,
     for in thy favour they are strong.

4. All glory unto God we yield,
     Jehovah is our help and shield;
   all praise and honour we will bring
     to Israel’s Holy One, our King.


Psalm 90  Lord, you have been our dwelling place

1. Lord, you have been our dwelling place
     through all the ages of our race.
   Before you gave the mountains birth
     or formed and fashioned all the earth,
   from years which no beginning had
     to years unending, you are God!

2. You turn man back to dust again;
     you say, “Return to dust, O men!”
   For in your sight a thousand years
     like yesterday, when past, appears;
   a thousand years are in your sight
     brief as a portion of the night.

3. You with a flood have swept men on,
     so like a sleep they’re quickly gone.
   They’re like the grass which quickly grows –
     each morning its new growth it shows;
   though green beneath the morning sun,
     it’s withered ere the day is done.

4. For by your anger we’re consumed,
     and by your wrath to terror doomed.
   Our sins you set before your sight,
     our secret sins in your clear light.
   Beneath your wrath we fade and die;
     our years are finished with a sigh.

5. For some life’s years are seventy;
     perhaps the strong may eighty see.
   Yet is their best but toil and woe;
     all quickly ends; how soon we go!
   Who has your anger understood?
     Who fears your fury as he should?

6. Teach us to count aright our days,
     to set our hearts in wisdom’s ways.
   Return, O Lord! How long will it be?
     Let us, your servants, mercy see.
   Your grace send with the morning rays;
     we’ll sing for joy through all our days.

7. Give joy that answers all the tears,
     the troubles in those days and years.
   Your work to all your children show;
     your glory on their sons bestow.
   O Lord our God, let favour rest;
     our works confirm, our labours bless.


Psalm 91  The one whose dwelling is with God

1. The one whose dwelling is with God Most High
     in the Almighty’s shadow safe will rest.
   “He is my refuge,” I say of the Lord,
     “my fortress and my God; in him I trust.”

2. Surely he saves you from the fowler's snare
     and rescues you from deadly pestilence.
   Under his wings a refuge you will find;
     his faithfulness will be your strong defence.

3. You will not fear the terror of the night,
     or dread the arrow flying in the day,
   or pestilence that in the darkness stalks,
     or plague at noon that carries all away.

4. No harm will touch you though a thousand fall,
     or yet ten thousand die at your right hand.
   Your eyes will then look on, and you will see
     the wicked punished as their ways demand.

5. If you make God Most High your dwelling place –
     even the Lord, who is my refuge sure –  
   no evil then will ever fall on you,
     nor dire calamity come near your door.

6. For he will charge his angels with your care,
     to guard you in your footsteps every one;
   they will uphold and bear you in their hands,
     lest you should strike your foot against a stone.

7. Upon the mighty lion you will tread;
     the cobra you will overcome and kill.
   Your feet will trample down the king of beasts;
     the serpent will be crushed beneath your heel.

8. “Because he loves me,” says the Sovereign Lord,
     “I’ll rescue and deliver him from harm.
   Since he acknowledges my holy name,
     I will protect him with my mighty arm.

9. “He’ll call on me, and I will answer him;
     with him in time of trouble I will be.
   I will deliver him and honour him.
     Long will he live, and my salvation see.”


Psalm 92  How good it is to thank the Lord

1. How good it is to thank the Lord,
     to praise your name with tuneful chord,
     to show your love with morning light
     and tell your faithfulness each night.
   Yes, it is good your praise to sing,
     and all our sweetest music bring.

2. O Lord, my song with joy expands
     before the wonders of your hands.
     How great the works that you have wrought;
     how deep, O Lord, your every thought!
   A foolish man knows not their worth,
     nor he whose mind is of the earth.

3. Though as the grass the wicked grow,
     those evildoers do not know
     the endless ruin they will see.
     But God will reign eternally.
   All foes will fall before his might;
     the wicked shall be put to flight.

4. O Lord, you have exalted me
     with royal strength and dignity.
     With your anointing I am blest;
     your grace and favour on me rest.
   My eyes have seen the wicked die;
     my ears have heard their hopeless cry.

5. The righteous all will flourish well
     and in the house of God will dwell.
     They will be planted like a tree,
     will still in old age fruitful be,
   the Lord our God is upright, just;
     he is my rock; in him I trust.


Psalm 93  Jehovah sits enthroned

1. Jehovah sits enthroned
     in majesty most bright,
   apparelled in omnipotence,
     and girded round with might.

2. The world established stands
     on its foundations broad;
   his throne is fixed, he reigns supreme,
     the everlasting God.

3. The floods have lifted up
     their voice in majesty,
   but mighty is the Lord our God
     above the raging sea.

4. Thy testimonies, Lord,
     in faithfulness record,
   and holy must thy servant be
     who in thy temple dwell.


Psalm 94  Almighty Lord God

1. Almighty Lord God, who judges the earth,
     arise, give the proud just what they deserve.
   How long will they boast and in arrogance mock,
     oppressing the people you take as your flock?

2. They say God will not observe what they do,
     that he will not see the sins they pursue.
   The widows they murder, the fatherless snare;
     and strangers they kill, thinking God does not care.

3. You fools, our God knows how senseless you are!
     For he who made all can see near and far.
   Is God who first fashioned your eye and your ear
     unable to see you, unable to hear?

4. The people you teach and discipline, Lord,
     are happy and blest to learn from your word.
   For you grant relief to all those in despair,
     allowing them peace till the wicked are snared.

5. O Lord, you will not abandon your own
     nor ever forsake them nor leave them alone.
   Your justice will dawn for all those who do right,
     and those who are upright will follow its light.

6. Who helps me to fight sin’s mighty offence?
     Who will be my shield and my sure defence?
   Unless God had helped me when evil oppressed,
     I too would have slipped into silence and death.

7. Whenever I fall, I pleadingly cry;
     then your loving hand, Lord, holds me up high.
   If my heart should doubt and be filled with despair,
     your comfort brings joy, and I know that you care.

8. Corruption cannot be allied with you;
     injustice cannot be legal or true.
   For you, Lord, will never conspire with our foes
     who gather together, increasing our woes.

9. The Lord is my rock, invincible, strong;
     he punishes all who perpetrate wrong.
   Our God will repay them for sins they have sown,
     but he will have mercy and love for his own.


Psalm 95  Now with joyful exultation

1. Now with joyful exultation
     let us sing Jehovah’s praise;
     to the rock of our salvation
     loud hosannas let us raise.
   Thankful tribute gladly bringing,
     let us come before him now,
     and, with psalms his praises singing,
     joyful in his presence bow.

2. For how great a God, and glorious,
     is Jehovah whom we sing;
     over idol gods victorious,
     great is he, our God and King.
   In his hand are earth’s deep places,
     his the strength of all the hills,
     his the sea whose bounds he traces,
     his the land his bounty fills.

3. To the Lord, such might revealing,
     let us come with reverence meet,
     and, before our Maker kneeling,
     let us worship at his feet.
   He is our own God and leads us,
     we the people of his care;
     with a shepherd's hand he feeds us
     as his flock in pastures fair.

4. While he offers peace and pardon
     let us hear his voice today,
     lest, if we our hearts should harden,
     we should perish in the way;
   lest to us, so unbelieving,
     he in judgment shall declare:
     “You, so long my spirit grieving,
     never in my rest can share.”


Psalm 95b  Sing to the Lord, the rock!

1. Sing to the Lord, the rock of our salvation!
     Sing to the Lord a song of joy and praise!
   Kneel in his presence, lowly in thanksgiving!
     The lofty psalm upraise! 

2. The land and sea are his, for he has made them,
     the valleys of the earth, its rugged hills;
   cornland and vineyards and the olive orchards,
     all these his mercy fills.

3. And we, his people, sheep of his own pasture,
     lambs of his bosom, whom his hand has fed,
   shall we not hearken to our kindly shepherd
     by whom our feet are led?

4. Oh, harden not your hearts, like those who wandered
     the desert forty years to Jordan’s strand;
   humble and comforted, O chosen people,
     enter the promised land.


Psalm 96  Sing to the Lord, sing his praise

1. Sing to the Lord, sing his praise, all you peoples;
     new be your song as new honours you pay.
   Sing of his majesty, praise him forever,
     show his salvation from day to day.

2. Tell of his wondrous works, tell of his glory,
     till through the nations his name is revered.
   Praise and exalt him, for he is almighty;
     God over all, let the Lord be feared.

3. Vain are the idols and gods of the nations;
     God made the heav’ns, and his glory they tell.
   Splendour and majesty shine out before him;
     glory and strength in his temple dwell.

4. Give unto God Most High glory and honour;
     come with your offerings and humbly draw near.
   Worship the Lord in all beauty and splendour;
     tremble before him with godly fear.

5. Say to the nations, “The Lord reigns forever.”
     Earth is established as he did decree.
   Righteous and just is the King of the nations,
     judging the peoples with equity.

6. Let heav’n and earth be glad; oceans, be joyful;
     forest and field, exultation express.
   For God is coming, the Judge of the nations,
     coming to judge in his righteousness.


Psalm 97  Jehovah reigns, let earth be glad!

1. Jehovah reigns, let earth be glad!
     Let distant shores express delight!
   Clouds and thick darkness cover him;
     his throne is built on truth and right.

2. Fire goes before him and consumes
     his enemies on every side.
   His lightning flashes through the world;
     at this the earth is terrified.

3. Hills melt like wax before the Lord;
     before the Lord of all the earth.
   The heav’ns proclaim his righteousness;
     all peoples see his glorious worth.

4. All those who worship images
     are put to everlasting shame;
   their worthless idols are their boast –
     you gods, bow down before his name!

5. To Zion’s hill and Judah’s towns
     your judgments, Lord, great joy supply.
   Above the earth and all the gods
     exalted is the Lord Most High.

6. Hate evil, you who love the Lord;
     his faithful ones he will defend,
   and from the hands of wicked men
     to them deliv’rance he will send.

7. Upon the righteous light will shine,
     and joy on those of upright ways.
   You righteous, in the Lord rejoice,
     and to his holy name give praise.


Psalm 98  Sing a new song to Jehovah

1. Sing a new song to Jehovah
     for the wonders he has wrought.
     His right hand and arm most holy
     triumph to his cause have brought.
   In his love and tender mercy
     he has made salvation known;
     in the sight of every nation,
     he his righteousness has shown.

2. Truth and mercy toward his people
     he has ever kept in mind,
     and his full and free salvation
     he has shown to all mankind.
   Sing, O earth, sing to Jehovah,
     praises to Jehovah sing;
     with the swelling notes of music
     shout before the Lord, the King.

3. Seas and all your fullness, thunder;
     all earth’s peoples, now rejoice;
     floods and hills, in praise uniting,
     to the Lord lift up your voice.
   For behold, Jehovah cometh,
     robed in justice and in might;
     he alone will judge the nations,
     and his judgment shall be right.


Psalm 98b  Unto God our Saviour

1. Unto God our Saviour
     sing a joyful song;
     wondrous are his doings,
     for his arm is strong.
   He has wrought salvation,
     he has made it known,
     and before the nations
     is his justice shown.

2. Joyful, all ye people,
     sing before the Lord;
     shout and sing his praises
     now in glad accord.
   With the harp and trumpet
     joyful praises bring;
     come, rejoice before him,
     God, the Lord, your King.

3. Waves of mighty ocean,
     earth with fullness stored,
     floods and fields and mountains,
     sing before the Lord;
   for he comes with justice,
     evil to redress,
     and to judge the nations
     in his righteousness.


Psalm 99  Jehovah reigns in majesty

1. Jehovah reigns in majesty,
     let all the nations quake;
     he dwells between the cherubim,
     let earth’s foundations shake.
   Supreme in Zion is the Lord,
     exalted gloriously;
     ye nations, praise his name with awe,
     the Holy One is he.

2. The mighty King loves justice well,
     and equity ordains;
     he rules his people righteously
     and faithfulness maintains.
   O magnify the Lord our God,
     let him exalted be;
     in worship at his footstool bow,
     the Holy One is he.

3. When priests and prophets called on God,
     he their petitions heard;
     his cloudy pillar led them on,
     and they obeyed his word.
   Though sending judgments for their sins,
     he pardoned graciously;
     exalt the Lord and worship him,
     the Holy One is he.


Psalm 100  Shout to the Lord with joy

1. Shout to the Lord with joy,
     all who to earth belong.
     Adore the Lord with joyful hearts
     and come to him in song.
   Know that the Lord is God;
     he made us as his own.
     We are the sheep for whom he cares –
     his people, his alone.

2. Enter his gates with praise,
     his courts with thankfulness.
     Your praises gladly sing to him;
     his name forever bless.
   For God the Lord is good;
     his love is ever sure.
     His constant truth and faithfulness
     through every age endure.


Psalm 100b  All people that on earth do dwell

1. All people that on earth do dwell,
     sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
   him serve with mirth, his praise forth tell,
     come ye before him and rejoice.

2. Know that the Lord is God indeed;
     without our aid he did us make,
   we are his flock, he doth us feed,
     and for his sheep he doth us take.

3. O enter then his gates with joy,
     within his courts his praise proclaim;
   let thankful songs your tongues employ,
     O bless and magnify his name.

4. Because the Lord our God is good,
     his mercy is forever sure;
   his truth at all times firmly stood
     and shall from age to age endure.


Psalm 101  I’ll praise your love and justice

1. I’ll praise your love and justice, Lord;
     I’ll praise you cheerfully.
   I’ll strive to lead a blameless life –
     when will you come to me?

2. Within my home the life I lead
     will show a blameless heart.
   My eyes will view no worthless thing;
     from sin I will depart.

3. I hate what faithless people do;
     it shall not cling to me.
   All wicked people I’ll avoid,
     from evil I’ll stay free.

4. I’ll put to silence everyone
     who slanders secretly;
   I will not tolerate the proud
     who act so haughtily.

5. My eyes are on the faithful ones,
     that they may dwell with me;
   whoever lives a blameless life
     will serve me constantly.

6. No one who practises deceit
     will dwell within my home;
   nor will the one whose words are false
     before me ever come.

7. Each morning I will silence all
     who wicked deeds have done;
   I’ll cleanse the city of the Lord
     of every evil one.


Psalm 102  Lord, listen to my prayer

1. Lord, listen to my prayer,
     and hear my cry for aid.
     Hide not your face from me,
     for I am so afraid.
   Incline your ear to me in need;
     and, when I call, be swift to heed.

2. Like smoke my days are gone;
     my bones are burned away.
     My appetite is lost;
     my heart is parched like hay.
   Because of my incessant groans
     I am no more than skin and bones.

3. I'm like a desert owl,
     an owl midst tumbled stone,
     or bird upon a roof –
     I lie awake, alone.
   My foes revile me all day long;
     my haters mock my name in song.

4. For ashes are my food;
     I weep incessantly
     because in your great wrath
     you have abandoned me.
   My days like evening shadows pass;
     I wither like the sun-dried grass.

5. But you, O Lord, are set
     forever on your throne;
     through each succeeding age
     endures your great renown.
   You will arise in mighty power;
     on Zion mercy you will shower.

6. The set time now has come
     to bless Jerusalem.
     Her stones your saints hold dear;
     her dust is mourned by them.
   Nations will fear your name, O Lord;
     all kings on earth your praise record.

7. For God will yet appear
     in glorious might to reign;
     the Lord in grace will build
     Jerusalem again.
   The prayers of all the poor he’ll heed;
     he will not spurn their cry of need.

8. Let this be written down
     to teach a future race,
     so people yet unborn
     may magnify his grace:
   that from his holy place above
     the Lord looked down in tender love.

9. From heav’n he viewed the earth,
     observing all mankind,
     to hear the groans of those
     in prison cells confined,
   and to deliver from on high
     a multitude condemned to die.

10. In Zion will be praised
     the Lord’s exalted name;
     his praises will be sung
     within Jerusalem,
   when peoples and their kingdoms throng
     to serve the Lord with cheerful song.

11. He took my strength away
     by his almighty power;
     he shortened grievously
     my life’s allotted hour.
   I said, “O take me not away,
     my God, at noontide of my day.

12. “Your days and years go on
     through every age of man.
     The earth’s foundation strong
     you laid when time began.
   The heavens came at your command,
     created by your mighty hand.

13. “The earth and heav’ns will fail,
     but you alone remain.
     Like garments they will age,
     while you on high will reign.
   Like clothing you will change them all;
     like clothes discarded they will fall.

14. “But you endure always;
     your years will never cease.
     Your servants’ children too
     will know your reign of peace.
   Their offspring, their succeeding race,
     will ever stand before your face.”


Psalm 103  Praise God, my soul!

1. Praise God, my soul! With all my heart
     let me exalt his holy name.
     Forget not all his benefits;
     his praise, my soul, in song proclaim.
   The Lord forgives you all your sins,
     and heals your sickness and distress;
     your life he rescues from the grave,
     and crowns you in his tenderness.

2. He satisfies your deep desires
     from his unending stores of good,
     so that, just like the eagle’s strength,
     your youthful vigour is renewed.
   The Lord is known for righteous acts
     and justice to downtrodden ones.
     To Moses he made known his ways,
     his mighty deeds to Israel's sons.

3. The Lord is merciful and kind,
     to anger slow, and full of grace.
     He will not constantly reprove
     or in his anger hide his face.
   He does not punish our misdeeds
     or give our sins their just reward.
     How great his love, as high as heaven –
     towards all those who fear the Lord!

4. As far as east is from the west,
     so far his love has borne away
     our many sins and trespasses
     and all the guilt that on us lay.
   Just as a father loves his child,
     so God loves those who fear his name.
     For he remembers we are dust,
     and well he knows our feeble frame.

5. Each human life is like the grass,
     and like a meadow flower it grows.
     Its place will never be recalled
     once over it the tempest blows.
   But everlasting is God’s love
     for those who fear him, and their seed –
     for those who keep his covenant,
     and carefully his precepts heed.

6. God’s kingly rule is over all;
     in heav-en he has set his throne.
     O you his angels, praise the Lord,
     strong ones by whom his will is done.
   O praise the Lord, you heavenly hosts,
     his servants who perform his word.
     Praise God, his works throughout his realm,
     and you, my soul, O praise the Lord!


Psalm 103b  O come my soul, bless thou the Lord

1. O come, my soul, bless thou the Lord thy Maker,
     and all within me, bless his holy name;
   bless thou the Lord, forget not all his mercies,
     his pardoning grace and saving love proclaim.

   Bless him, ye angels, wondrous in might.
   Bless him, his servants, that in his will delight.

2. Good is the Lord, and full of kind compassion,
     most slow to anger, plenteous in love;
   rich is his grace to all that humbly seek him,
     boundless and endless as the heavens above.

   Bless him, ye angels, wondrous in might.
   Bless him, his servants, that in his will delight.

3. His love is like a father’s to his children,
     tender and kind to all who fear his name;
   for well he knows our weakness and our frailty,
     he knows that we are dust, he knows our frame.

   Bless him, ye angels, wondrous in might.
   Bless him, his servants, that in his will delight.

4. We fade and die like flowers that grow in beauty,
     like tender grass that soon will disappear;
   but evermore the love of God is changeless,
     still shown to those who look to him in fear.

   Bless him, ye angels, wondrous in might.
   Bless him, his servants, that in his will delight.

5. High in the heav’ns his throne is fixed forever,
     his kingdom rules o’er all from pole to pole.
   Bless ye the Lord through all his wide dominion;
     bless his most holy name, O thou my soul.

   Bless him, ye angels, wondrous in might.
   Bless him, his servants, that in his will delight.


Psalm 104  My soul, bless the Lord!

1. My soul, bless the Lord! The Lord is most great,
     with glory arrayed, majestic his state.
   The light is his garment, the skies are his shade,
     and over the waters his courts he has laid.

2. He rides on the clouds and wings of the storm;
     the lightning and wind his mission perform.
   Foundations of earth he forever has stayed;
     to cover it, oceans like garments were laid.

3. On mountains and plains the dark waters lay.
     They heard his rebuke and melted away.
   He lifted the mountains, to valleys gave birth,
     set bound’ries for seas that once covered the earth.

4. God causes the springs of water to flow
     in streams from the hills to valleys below.
   Beside them with singing the birds greet the day,
     and there the beasts gather their thirst to allay.

5. Down mountains and hills your showers are sent.
     With fruit of your work the earth is content.
   You give grass for cattle and food for our toil,
     enriching our labours with bread, wine, and oil.

6. The trees which the Lord has planted are fed,
     and over the earth their branches are spread;
   they keep in their shelter the birds of the air.
     The life of each creature the Lord makes his care.

7. The seasons are fixed by wisdom divine.
     The slow-changing moon shows forth God’s design.
   The sun in its circuit its Maker obeys
     and, running its journey, hastes not nor delays.

8. The Lord makes the night, when, leaving their lair,
     the lions go forth, God’s bounty to share.
   The Lord makes the morning, when beasts steal away
     and man is beginning his work of the day.

9. How many and wise the works of the Lord!
     The earth with its wealth of creatures is stored.
   The sea bears in safety the ships to and fro;
     Leviathan plays in the waters below.

10. Your creatures all look to you for their food;
     your hand opens wide, they gather the good.
   When you hide your face, Lord, in anguish they yearn;
     when you stop their breath, then to dust they return.

11. Your Spirit, O Lord, makes life to abound,
     the earth is renewed, and fruitful the ground.
   To God ascribe glory and wisdom and might;
     let God in his creatures forever delight.

12. Before the Lord’s might earth trembles and quakes,
     the mountains are rent, and smoke from them breaks.
 The Lord I will worship through all of my days,
     yes, while I have being, my God I will praise.

13. Rejoicing in God, my thought shall be sweet.
     May sinners depart in ruin complete.
   My soul, bless Jehovah – his name be adored.
     Come, praise him, all people, and worship the Lord.


Psalm 105  Give thanks to the Lord God

1. Give thanks to the Lord God and call on his name;
     his wonderful deeds to the nations proclaim.
     Sing praises to him, and his exploits record;
     let all those who seek him rejoice in the Lord.
   You chosen ones, look to the Lord and his might;
     seek ever his face, and his wonders recite,
     his miracles too, and his judgment divine –
     you children of Abraham, Jacob’s own line.

2. The Lord is our God, and he rules all the earth.
     Remembering his covenant – the word he set forth –
     he vowed, for the ages to come, to make good
     his promise to Abraham, to Isaac renewed.
   To Jacob his sovereign decree was made sure;
     with Israel his covenant would always endure:
     “To you I will give, as your portion to stand,
     the country of Canaan, the beautiful land.”

3. When they were no more than a wandering few;
     in number restricted and foreigners too,
     from nation to nation they travelled around;
     wherever they wandered, no rest could be found.
   He would not permit Israel to be oppressed;
     for his people’s sake mighty kings he addressed:
     “Touch not my anointed – to me they belong;
     respect my own prophets and do them no wrong.”

4. The Lord called down famine upon the whole land;
     their food was destroyed at his sovereign command.
     But he sent beforehand, his people to save,
     his chosen one, Joseph, sold off as a slave.
   His feet within shackles of bronze were confined,
     his neck put in irons; for freedom he pined.
     The word of the Lord was a test to be passed
     till what he foretold was accomplished at last.

5. The king sent an order to let him go free;
     the ruler of nations gave him liberty.
     He put him in charge of his house and his lands;
     his princes and elders obeyed his commands.
   Then Israel came down into Egypt to stay,
     in Ham’s land to sojourn for many a day.
     The Lord caused his people to prosper and grow,
     and so they were seen as a threat to their foe.

6. He turned the Egyptians against Israèl,
     and caused them to plot his own servants to kill.
     Then Moses and Aaron, his chosen, he sent;
     performing his wonders, to Egypt they went.
   Because the Egyptians despised his command,
     he sent utter darkness to cover the land.
     Their waters and rivers he turned into blood;
     the fish of the Nile were destroyed by the Lord.

7. Their land teemed with frogs which invaded their rooms;
     his word brought the gnats; swarms of flies filled their homes.
     The rain became hail, and the lightning bolts flashed;
     he struck down their vines, and their fig trees were smashed.
   He spoke and the locusts and grasshoppers came;
     and every green thing was consumed as by flame.
     And then he took vengeance on all the firstborn –
     the first fruits of manhood of Egypt were gone.

8. He brought Israel out bearing silver and gold;
     the tribes all marched forwards both steadfast and bold.
     Then Egypt was joyful to see them depart,
     for terror of them had laid hold of their heart.
   He spread out a cloud to protect them from sight,
     and fire to illumine the hours of the night.
     They asked, and with quails were abundantly fed;
     he filled them with manna, the heavenly bread.

9. He opened the rock to give waters to them,
     and there in the desert it flowed like a stream –
     because he remembered the promise he swore
     to Abraham his servant, long ages before.
   He brought out his chosen ones, shouting with joy;
     he granted to them without toil to enjoy
     the lands of the nations – that they might regard
     his law and his precepts. All praise to the Lord!


Psalm 105b  Unto the Lord lift thankful voices

1. Unto the Lord lift thankful voices,
     come, worship while your soul rejoices;
   make known his doings far and near
     that peoples all his name may fear.
   Tell of his wonders day by day,
     and to his deeds attention pay.

2. In joyful song your hearts uniting,
     his works most marvellous reciting,
   now glory in his holy name;
     let those that seek him spread his fame,
   incline their hearts to sing his praise,
     and unto him their anthems raise.

3. Seek ye Jehovah and his power,
     seek ye his presence every hour.
   His works, so marvellous and great,
     remember still and med-i-tate
   upon the wonders of his hands,
     the judgments which his mouth commands.

4. Ye seed from Abraham descended
     to whom his favours were extended,
   and Jacob’s children, whom the Lord
     has chosen, hearken to his word.
   He is the Lord, our judge divine;
     in all the earth his glories shine,

5. Jehovah’s truth will stand forever,
     his covenant-bonds he will not sever;
   the word of grace which he commands
     to thousand generations stands;
   the covenant made in days of old
     with Abraham he doth uphold.

6. The Lord his covenant people planted
     in lands of nations which he granted,
   that they his statutes might observe,
     nor from his laws might ever swerve.
   Let songs of praise to him ascend,
     and hallelujahs without end.


Psalm 106  Praise the Lord! Extol his goodness!

1. Praise the Lord! Extol his goodness!
     for his love endures always.
   Who can tell his mighty actions,
     or in full declare his praise?
   Blest are those whose way is right,
     acting justly in his sight.

2. When you show your people favour,
     then, O Lord, remember me.
   Help me when you come to save them;
     let me know prosperity –
   joyful with your chosen race,
     joining them in giving praise.

3. We have sinned, just like our fathers;
     we have done what was not right.
   When our fathers were in Egypt,
     they despised your deeds of might.
   All your mercies, they ignored –
     at the Red Sea spurned the Lord.

4. Yet for his name’s sake he saved them
     and revealed his mighty hand.
   By his word the Sea he parted,
     led them through as on dry land –
   from the hand of foes set free,
     rescued from the enemy.

5. Then their adversaries foundered;
     not a single one survived.
   So the people sang his praises,
     and his promises believed;
   but his works they soon forgot,
     and his counsel set at nought.

6. In the desert they surrendered
     to their unremitting greed;
   in the wasteland they provoked him,
     craving meat they did not need.
   So he gave them what they sought,
     but on them disease he brought.

7. In the camp they envied Moses,
     Aaron too – God’s priest was he.
   Earth was split and swallowed Dathan
     and Abiram’s company;
   there they fell, consumed by flame –
     those who had abused God’s name.

8. Then they made a calf at Horeb –
     served an idol cast in clay;
   they exchanged their highest glory
     for a bull that feeds on hay.
   God their saviour they forgot,
     who for them great things had wrought.

9. They forgot his deeds in Egypt,
     marvels in the land of Ham.
   So he said he would destroy them –
     had not Moses, his own man,
   stood before God in the path,
     shielding them from righteous wrath.

10. Then they scorned the land of plenty;
     they did not believe his word.
   In their tents they grumbled at him,
     and did not obey the Lord.
   So he vowed, with upraised hand,
     they would fall in desert sand.

11. Their descendants he would punish –
     scatter over lands abroad.
   Yet they yoked themselves to Baal,
     worshipping a lifeless god.
   Their transgressions God abhorred;
     so a plague came from the Lord.

12. But when Phinehas took action
     and ungodliness defied,
   then the deadly plague was halted,
     and his deed was ratified
   by the Lord as rightly done,
     for the ages yet to come.

13. Then at Meribah’s still waters
     they provoked the Lord again.
   They rebelled against God’s Spirit,
     causing Moses bitter pain –
   for he spoke, possessed by grief,
     rashly and in unbelief.

14. They did not destroy the peoples
     in accord with God’s command,
   but they mixed with them, and followed
     all the customs of the land,
   worshipping the idols there,
     which to them became a snare.

15. Sons they sacrificed and daughters
     to a Canaanitish god;
   thus the land was desecrated
     by the stain of guiltless blood.
 By their acts they were defiled –
     into filthiness beguiled.

16. So the Lord was angry with them,
     and his people he abhorred –
   gave them over to the nations,
     and their foe became their lord.
   Subject to their enemy,
     they were treated cruelly.

17. Many times he showed his power
     by delivering his own,
   but they set their heart on sinning
     and rebelled against his throne.
   In their sin they chose to stay,
     and they wasted quite away.

18. But when they appealed for mercy,
     he took note in heav’n above;
   he recalled his covenant with them
     and relented in his love.
   So he made their captors all
     pity those they held in thrall.

19. Gather us, Lord, from the nations;
     save us, and your name we’ll praise.
   Blessèd be the God of Israel;
     may his glory last always.
   Let the Lord be praised again!
     Let the people say, “Amen!”


Psalm 107  O thank the Lord, for he is good

1. O thank the Lord, for he is good;
     his love endures always.
     Let those whom God redeemed say this,
     those rescued by his grace.
   He saved them from their enemies
     and brought them from the lands,
     from east and west, from north and south,
     safe from oppressing hands.

2. Some wandered in the desert wastes,
     not finding any way
     to reach a city where they might
     obtain a place to stay.
   Their life and strength were ebbing fast
     in thirst and emptiness.
     Then in despair they sought the Lord,
     who saved them from distress

3. Straight was the path he led them on,
     a city to attain.
     So for the Lord’s unfailing love
     let them give thanks again,
   and for the awesome deeds of power
     which he for men achieves –
     for hungry souls he fills with good;
     the thirsty he relieves.

4. Some sat in darkness and in gloom,
     in chains of iron held;
     they scorned the ways of God Most High,
     against his words rebelled.
   And so he made them labour hard
     in bitterness and shame.
     They stumbled, and they could not rise;
     to help them no one came.

5. Then to the Lord they cried for help;
     he saved them from their doom.
     He broke away their cruel chains
     and brought them out of gloom.
   So let them thank him for his love,
     the deeds which he achieves –
     because he breaks down gates of bronze
     and iron bars he cleaves.

6. Some erred through their rebellious ways
     and for their sins paid dear.
     All kinds of food revolted them;
     the gates of death drew near.
   Then in despair they sought the Lord;
     he saved them from their doom.
     His word went forth with healing power
     and kept them from the tomb.

7. So for the Lord’s unfailing love
     let them give thanks again,
     and for the awesome deeds of power
     which he achieves for men.
   Let them prepare a sacrifice
     and bring an offering;
     in praise of all his mighty acts
     let them rejoice and sing.

8. Yet others traded on the sea;
     they sailed the ocean’s length.
     They saw the wonders of the Lord,
     and on the deep his strength.
   For when he spoke, a tempest rose;
     the sea grew wild and rough.
     They mounted up to heav’n and then
     went down into the trough.

9. At this their courage fled away,
     for danger was in view.
     They reeled and staggered as with drink;
     they knew not what to do.
   Then in despair they sought the Lord,
     who saved them from distress.
     He stilled the storm, so that the waves
     were hushed in quietness.

10. Their joy was great when it grew calm;
     they anchored safe again.
     Then let them thank him for his love,
     his awesome deeds for men.
   So in the elders’ council may
     they ever praise the Lord;
     and in the people’s gathering
     let them exalt their God.

11. He changed the streams to wilderness,
       fresh springs to desert bare,
     and fruitful land to barren waste,
     for sins of dwellers there.
   He changed parched ground to flowing streams;
     the hungry there he led
     to found a city safe and strong,
     which they inhabited.

12. They reaped a fruitful harvest from
     the vineyard and the field.
     He blessed and made them multiply;
     their herds maintained their yield.
   They faced decline, their fortunes fell,
     they suffered great distress.
     Brought low by him who scorns the proud,
     they roamed the wilderness.

13. But he did not abandon them;
     he brought the needy folk
     from their affliction and increased
     their families like a flock.
   The upright see this and are glad;
     the wicked hold their peace.
     Let all the wise take note and learn
     the Lord’s love does not cease.


Psalm 108  O Lord God, my heart is steadfast

1. O Lord God, my heart is steadfast,
     and with all my soul I’ll sing.
   Harp and lyre I will awaken,
     and my song the dawn will bring.

2. Lord my God, among the nations
     I will ever give you praise;
   in the midst of all the peoples
     I will sing of you always.

3. For your steadfast love is boundless,
     greater than the heavens high;
   and your faithfulness towards us
     reaches even to the sky.

4. Far above the highest heavens
     be exalted, O my God;
   and through all the earth around us
     let your glory spread abroad.

5. With your right hand save and help us;
     rescue all those whom you love.
   God has spoken from his temple,
     from his holy place above:

6. “I will distribute in triumph
     every part of Shechem’s land,
   and the whole of Succoth valley
     I will measure with my hand.

7. “Mine is Gilead, mine Manasseh,
     Ephraim is my helmet true;
   Judah I will make my sceptre
     and on Edom toss my shoe.

8. “Moab will become my servant,
     and upon Philistia’s shore
   I will shout aloud in triumph;
     I am Lord and conqueror.”

9. Who will bring me to the city
     that is strongly fortified,
   and to reach the land of Edom
     who will be my help and guide?

10. Have you not, O God, rejected,
     turned us over to our foe?
   When our armies go to battle,
     with them you no longer go.

11. Since all human help is worthless,
     God will give us victory;
   He it is who will defend us
     and tread down our enemy.


Psalm 109  O my God, whose name I worship

1. O my God, whose name I worship, be not silent, Lord, I pray;
     for the wicked and deceitful speak against me every day.
   They have uttered lies against me; with malicious tongues they fight.
     Without cause they rush upon me, closing in with words of spite.

2. In return for love they blame me, though for them I daily pray.
     They reward my good with evil, for my friendship hate repay.
   Set an evil man against him at his right hand to denounce.
     May his very prayers condemn him; let the court his guilt pronounce.

3. May his rule pass to another; short and wretched be his life.
     Fatherless shall be his children, make a widow of his wife.
   May his children beg and wander, driven from their ruined gate.
     May his gods be seized and taken – strangers plunder his estate.

4. May no one take pity on him or his orphans in their plight.
     May his family line be ended, and their names be lost to sight.
   May the Lord remember ever all his parents’ sin and shame.
     May their sin be held against them, and forgotten be their name.

5. For he never thought of helping those in trouble or distress;
     but to death the poor he hounded, and the weak and comfortless.
   He was always cursing others – may his curse on him rebound;
     he took no delight in blessing – far from him may it be found.

6. He wore cursing as his garment – to his bones it soaked like oil;
     it poured down his throat like water. May his curses round him coil.
   May they cling to him forever, wrapped around him like a cloak.
     May this be the Lord’s repayment to those false, accusing folk.

7. But, O Sovereign Lord, in mercy deal with me for your name’s sake;
     save me in your love and goodness, and my life from danger take.
   For I am both poor and needy; crushed within me is my heart.
     I am feeble, like an insect; like a shadow I depart.

8. See, my knees give way from fasting; and my frame is thin and gaunt.
     My accusers, when they see me, shake their heads at me and taunt.
   Lord my God, draw near and help me; save me in your steadfast love.
     Let them know your hand has done it, that my help comes from above.

9. They may curse, but you will bless me, and your servant will give praise.
     Clothed with shame be my accusers, my attackers with disgrace.
   I will loudly sing God’s praises and extol him in the throng;
     for he helps and saves the needy from all those who do them wrong.


Psalm 110  The Lord unto my Lord has said

1. The Lord unto my Lord has said,
     “Sit here at my right hand
     until I make your enemies
     submit to your command.”
   A scepter prospered by the Lord
     your mighty hand shall wield;
     from Zion you shall rule the world,
     and all your foes shall yield.

2. Your people will be gladly yours
     when you arise in might,
     like dawning day, like hopeful youth,
     with holy beauty bright.
   The priesthood of Melchizedek
     the Lord has given you;
     it shall remain forevermore;
     God’s word is always true.

3. You shall subdue the kings of earth,
     with God at your right hand,
     the nations you shall rule in might
     and judge in every land.
   The Lord, refreshed by living streams,
     shall neither faint nor fall,
     and he shall be the glorious head,
     exalted over all.


Psalm 111  O give the Lord wholehearted praise

1. O give the Lord wholehearted praise.
     To him thanksgiving I will bring;
   with all his people I will raise
     my voice and of his glory sing.

2. His saints delight to search and trace
     his mighty works and wondrous ways.
   Majestic glory, boundless grace,
     and righteousness his work displays.

3. God’s wondrous deeds of faithfulness
     his people ever keep in mind.
   His works of love and graciousness
     reveal that God the Lord is kind.

4. God’s promise shall forever stand;
     he cares for those who trust his word.
   Upon his saints his mighty hand
     the wealth of nations has conferred.

5. His works are true and just indeed;
     his precepts are forever sure.
   In truth and righteousness decreed,
     they shall forevermore endure.

6. From him his saints’ redemption came;
     his covenant sure no change can know;
   let all revere his holy name
     in heav’n above and earth below.

7. In rev’rence and in godly fear
     man finds the gate to wisdom’s ways;
   the wise his holy name revere.
     Through endless ages sound his praise.


Psalm 112  How blest the man

1. How blest the man who fears the Lord
     and greatly loves God's holy will;
   his children share his great reward,
     and blessings all their days shall fill.

2. Abounding wealth shall bless his home,
     his righteousness shall still endure,
   to him shall light arise in gloom,
     for he is merciful and pure.

3. The man whose hand the weak befriends
     in judgment shall his cause maintain.
   A peace unmoved his life attends,
     and long his memory shall remain.

4. Of evil tidings not afraid,
     his trust is in the Lord alone.
   His heart is steadfast, undismayed,
     for he shall see his foes o’erthrown,

5. With kind remembrance of the poor,
     for their distress his gifts provide.
   His righteousness shall thus endure;
     his name in honour shall abide.

6. To shame the wicked shall be brought,
     while righteous men shall favour gain.
   Unrighteous hopes shall come to naught;
     its due reward shall sin obtain.


Psalm 113  O praise, you servants of the Lord

1. O praise, you servants of the Lord;
     sing praises to his holy name.
     O blessed be the name of God;
     his praise forever more proclaim.
   From east to west the praise of God
     each day is to be spread abroad.

2. The Lord is high above the earth,
     his glory far above the sky.
     Who else is like the Lord our God,
     the one who sits enthroned on high?
   He is the one who stoops down low
     to look on heaven and earth below.

3. He raises outcasts from the dust,
     and from the ash heap lifts the poor;
     exalting them to dignity,
     with noblemen to sit secure.
   The childless woman he’ll reward
     with home and children.  Praise the Lord!


Psalm 114  When Israel out of Egypt came

1. When Israel out of Egypt came,
     from people of a foreign name,
   then Judah was God's holy home;
     in Israèl he set his throne.

2. The sea beheld and fled away;
     the Jordan’s waters stood at bay.
   The lofty mountains skipped like rams,
     and all the hills like little lambs.

3. O sea, why was it that you fled?
     O Jordan, that you backward sped?
   you mountains, that you skipped like rams,
     and all you hills, like little lambs.

4. O tremble, earth, before the Lord,
     before the face of Jacob’s God,
   who turned the rock into a pool;
     from flint there flowed the waters cool.


Psalm 115  Not unto us, O Lord of heaven

1. Not unto us, O Lord of heaven,
     but unto you be glory given;
     in love and truth you do fulfil
     the counsels of your sovereign will.
   Though nations fail your power to own,
     you are the King – you reign alone.

2. The idol gods of heathen lands
     are but the work of human hands:
     they cannot see, they cannot speak,
     their ears are deaf, their hands are weak.
   Like them shall be all those who hold
     to gods of silver and of gold.

3. O Israel, trust in God alone,
     the Lord, whose grace and power are known;
     to him your full allegiance yield,
     and he will be your help and shield.
   All those who fear him God will bless;
     his saints have proved his faithfulness.

4. All you that fear him and adore,
     the Lord increase you more and more;
     both great and small who God confess,
     you and your children he will bless.
   You all are blest by him who made
     the heav’ns and earth’s foundations laid.

5. The heav’ns are God’s since time began,
     but he has given the earth to man.
     The dead praise not the living God,
     but we will sound his praise abroad.
   Yes, we will ever bless his name;
     O praise the Lord, his praise proclaim.


Psalm 116  I love the Lord

1. I love the Lord because he heard my voice;
     he listened when I cried to him for aid.
   I’ll call on him as long as I shall live,
     because he turned to hear me when I prayed.

2. The cords of death gripped and entangled me,
     upon me came the anguish of the grave;
   with grief and trouble I was overcome.
     Then on the name of God I called: “Lord, save!”

3. The Lord our God is kind and full of grace;
     both righteous and compassionate is he.
   The Lord protects all those of childlike faith;
     when I was in great need, he rescued me.

4. Rest, O my soul; God has been good to you –
     for you, O Lord, have saved my soul from death,
   my feet from stumbling and my eyes from tears,
     that I may live for you while I have breath.

5. I trusted in the Lord, and then I spoke;
     I said in anguish: “I am sorely tried.”
   And in the very depths of my dismay,
     “All men are liars – every one!” I cried.

6. How can I thank the Lord for all he’s done?
     With gratitude salvation’s cup I’ll raise;
   I’ll call upon his name, and will fulfil
     my vows to him before his people’s face.

7. The Lord holds dear the death of all his saints.
     Hear me, O Lord! I am your servant true;
   I am your servant and your handmaid’s son,
     and from my chains I have been freed by you.

8. Thank offerings I will sacrifice to you
     and call upon the name of God the Lord.
   When all his people in assembly meet,
     with joy I will fulfil my solemn word.

9. Before his people I will keep my vows,
     within the courts of God’s own holy place,
   within the city of Jerusalem.
     Unto the Lord alone be all the praise!


Psalm 116b  I love the Lord, the fount of life

1. I love the Lord, the fount of life and grace;
     he hears my voice, my cry and supplication,
   inclines his ear, gives strength and consolation;
     in life, in death, my heart will seek his face.

2. The cords of death held me in deep despair;
     the pangs of hell, like waves by tempest driven,
   rolled o’er my soul; by grief and sorrow riven,
     I turned in my distress to God in prayer.

3. I cried, “Deliver thou my soul, O Lord!”
     Jehovah heard; I pledge him my devotion.
   The Lord is just, his grace wide as the ocean;
     in boundless mercy he fulfils his word.

4. The Lord preserves the meek most tenderly;
     brought nigh to death, in him I found salvation.
   Come, thou my soul, relieved from agitation,
     turn to thy rest; the Lord has favoured thee.

5. Thou, O Jehovah, in thy sovereign grace,
     hast saved my soul from death and woe appalling,
   dried all my tears, secured my feet from falling.
     Lo, I shall live and walk before thy face.

6. I have believed, and therefore did I speak
     when I was made to suffer tribulation;
   I said in haste and bitter desperation:
     “All men are false, ’tis nought but lies they speak.”

7. What shall I render to Jehovah now
     for all the riches of his consolation?
   With joy I’ll take the cup of his salvation
     and call upon his name with thankful vow.

8. Before his saints I’ll pay my vows to God;
     e’en in death’s vale he keepeth me from evil;
   how dear to God the dying of his people!
     Praise him, ye saints, and sound his name abroad.

9. I am, O Lord, thy servant, bound yet free,
     thy handmaid’s son, whose shackles thou hast broken;
   redeemed by grace I’ll render as a token
     of gratitude my constant praise to thee.

10. Jerusalem! Within thy courts I’ll praise
     Jehovah’s name, and with a spirit lowly
   pay all my vows. O Zion, fair and holy,

     he is the one who gives me aid.
   I’ll look in triumph on my foes;
     I will not need to be afraid.

     than look for help to man’s defence,
   It’s better far to trust the Lord
     than in a prince have confidence.

     in God’s great name I made them fall.

     but like a heap of thorns aflame
   they very quickly met their end.
     I slew them in the Lord’s great name.

     I’ll enter and give thanks to God.
   This is the gate of God, through which
     the righteous come before the Lord.

     salvation comes from you alone.
   The stone the builders had refused
     has now become the cornerstone.

13. The Lord himself has done all this;
     it is a marvel in our sight.
   This is the day the Lord has made;
     in it let us take great delight!

     O Lord, we pray, grant us success.
   He’s blest who comes in God’s great name;
     you from the Lord’s house we will bless.

15. The Lord is God, and he has made
     his glorious light upon us fall.
   Let us approach the altar’s horns
     and celebrate the festival.

     When enemies a-gainst me came,
     God’s strength provided my salvation:
     “His love forever is the same.”

3. Hark!  righteous and victorious singing:
     “The Lord’s right hand does valiantly.”
     For life restored my praises bringing:
     “The Lord’s right hand does valiantly.”
   When gates of righteousness stand open,
     I enter and I praise God’s name.
     This is God’s gate; the righteous enter.
     “His love forever is the same.”

4. The stone the builders had rejected
     is now the foremost cornerstone.
     The Lord has done it, we have seen it –
     his ways confound what we had known.
   This is the day of days: God made it!
     And we are glad, we praise his name:
     “Save us and let us know your blessing.
     Your love forever is the same.”

     Your love forever is the same!”

1. I cried in trouble to the Lord,
     and he has answered me.
     From lying lips and crafty tongue,
     O Lord, my soul set free.
   What shall be given you, false tongue?
     what added to your doom?
     Sharp arrows of a mighty man,
     and redhot coals of broom.

2. Alas for me that I sojourn
     so long in Meshech’s land;
     that I have made my dwelling where
     the tents of Kedar stand.
   Too long my soul has made its home
     with those who peace abhor.
     I am for peace; but when I speak,
     they ready are for war.


Psalm 121  To the hills I lift mine eyes

1. To the hills I lift mine eyes;
     whence shall help for me arise?

     will not suffer thee to fall.
     He who safe his people keeps
     slumbers not and never sleeps.

2. Thy protector is the Lord,
     shade for thee he will afford.
     Neither sun nor moon shall smite,
     God shall guard by day and night.

     to hear his word and worship him with praise.
   The throne of justice stands eternal there,
     Messiah’s throne through endless length of days.

     thy sons who hold thee dear shall prosper well.
   May blessing in thy palaces increase
     and peace within thy walls forever dwell.

     my prayer shall be, “Let peace in thee abide.”

Psalm 123  To you, O Lord, I lift my eyes

1. To you, O Lord, I lift my eyes,
     the God enthroned above the skies.
   As servants watch their master’s hand
     or maids before their mistress stand,
   so to the Lord our eyes we raise,
     until his mercy he displays.

2. O Lord our God, your mercy show;
     take pity, Lord, on us below.
   For scorn your people all have known;
     our foes’ contempt has made us groan.
   The proud have covered us with shame;
     with insolence they mock our name.


Psalm 124  If God the Lord

1. If God the Lord had not been on our side –
     let Israel say – had not the Lord been near
     when foes at-tacked us, filling us with fear,
   and when their wrath against us reached its height,
     alive we had been swallowed in their spite.

2. We would have been enveloped by the flood;
     over our heads the torrent would have gone;
     the waters would have carried us along.
   But praise the Lord, for he has set us free
     and has not left us to their cruelty.

3. We have escaped – just as a captured bird
     out of the fowler’s net has been set free;
     the snare is cut, we are at liberty.
   Our help is in the name of God the Lord,
     who made the earth and heavens by his word.


Psalm 125  All those who trust the Lord

1. All those who trust the Lord
     like Zion are secure,
     which never can be moved
     but always will endure.
   Just as the mountains stand
     around Jerusalem,
     the Lord surrounds his own,
     forever guarding them.

2. The wicked’s evil rule
     will not oppress for long
     the righteous and their land,
     lest righteous men do wrong.
   On all those who do good
     bestow your goodness, Lord –
     to those of upright heart
     who reverence your word.

3. But God will banish those
     who choose a crooked way;
     they’ll share the sinner’s fate.
     Let peace on Israel stay.


Psalm 126  When Zion’s fortunes God restored

1. When Zion’s fortunes God restored,
     it was a dream come true.
   Our mouths were then with laughter filled,
     our tongues with songs anew.

2. The nations said, “The Lord has done
     great things for Israel.”
   The Lord did mighty things for us,
     and joy our hearts knew well.

3. Restore our fortunes, gracious Lord,
     like streams in desert soil.
   A joyful harvest will reward
     the weeping sower’s toil.

4. The man who, bearing precious seed,
     weeps as in toil he grieves,
   will come again with songs of joy,
     and bearing harvest sheaves.


Psalm 127  Unless the Lord builds

1. Unless the Lord builds up the house,
     its builders toil in vain;
   unless he keeps the city safe,
     they vainly watch maintain.

2. In vain you rise before the dawn
     and late hours vainly keep
   that you may toil for food to eat –
     he gives his loved ones sleep.

3. Sons are a precious heritage,
     a blessing from the Lord;
   the children that are born to us
     are truly his reward.

4. Like arrows in a warrior’s hand
     are children of one’s youth.
   The man whose quiver’s full of them
     is blest by God in truth.

5. Such man will not be put to shame –
     that will not be their fate –
   when they contend against their foes
     who face them in the gate.


Psalm 128  How blest are all who fear the Lord

1. How blest are all who fear the Lord,
     who walk the way that he has shown.
   Success and blessing will be yours;
     you’ll eat the fruit that you have grown.

2. Your wife will be a fruitful vine;
     and round your table will be placed
   your children like young olive shoots.
     Thus he who fears the Lord is blest.

3. May you behold Jerusalem’s good;
     from Zion may God’s blessing flow.
   Your children’s children may you see.
     May God on Israel peace bestow.


Psalm 129  They have oppressed me

1. They have oppressed me from my youth –
     let Israèl now make this known –
   they have oppressed me from my youth;
     yet I have not been overthrown.

2. They drew their ploughs across my back;
     the ploughmen made their furrows long.
   The Lord is just, he cut me free
     from cords of those who did me wrong.

3. May all who hate Jerusalem
     be put to shame and turned away.
   May they, like grass upon the roof,
     not grow, but wither and decay.

4. Such grass can fill no reaper’s hands;
     the gatherer has no reward.
   May passers-by not say to them:
     “We wish you blessing from the Lord!”


Psalm 130  From out the depths I cry

1. From out the depths I cry, O Lord, to thee;
     Lord, hear my call.
   I love thee, Lord, for thou dost heed my plea,
     forgiving all.
   If thou shouldst mark our sins, who then could stand?
     But grace and mercy dwell at thy right hand.

2. I wait for God, the Lord, and on his word
     my hope relies.
   My soul still waits and looks unto the Lord
     till light arise.
   I look for him to drive away my night,
     yea, more than watchmen look for morning light.

3. Hope in the Lord, ye waiting saints, and he
     will well provide.
   For mercy and redemption full and free
     with him abide.
   From sin and evil, mighty though they seem,
     his arm almighty will his saints redeem.


Psalm 131  O Lord, my heart is not proud  

   O Lord, my heart is not proud,
     nor haughty my eyes.
     I have not gone after things too great,
     nor marvels beyond me.
   Truly I have set my soul, O Lord,
     in silence and peace;
     at rest as a child in its mother’s arms,
     so is my soul.
   O Israèl, put your hope in the Lord,
     now and forever!


Psalm 132  Lord our God, remember David

1. Lord our God, remember David
     and the hardships which he bore.
     To the Mighty One of Jacob,
     to the Lord, this oath he swore:
   “My house I will never enter;
     rest and slumber I will shun,
     till I find the Lord a dwelling
     fit for Jacob's Mighty One.”

2. We, in Ephrathah, have heard this,
     found it in the fields of Jaar:
     “Let us hasten to his dwelling
     worship at his footstool there.
   Rise, O Lord, and dwell among us,
     resting with your ark of might!
     May your priests be clothed with honour,
     may your saints sing with delight.”

3. For the sake of your own servant,
     David, your appointed one,
     do not turn away your favour
     from his own anointed son.
   God has sworn an oath to David;
     from it he will never turn:
     “I will choose from your descendants
     one to sit upon your throne.

4. “If your sons will keep my covenant
     and the statutes I make known,
     surely then shall their descendants
     sit forever on your throne.”
   For the Lord has chosen Zion –
     there he wishes to remain:
     “Here’s my resting place forever,
     here it pleases me to reign.

5. “I will bless her with abundance;
     for her poor much food I’ll bring.
     I will grant her priests salvation,
     and with joy her saints will sing.
   I will raise a horn for David,
     for my chosen one a light.
     With disgrace his foes I’ll cover,
     he’ll be crowned with glory bright.”


Psalm 133  How excellent a thing it is

1. How excellent a thing it is,
     how pleasant and how good,
   when brothers dwell in unity
     and live as brothers should!

2. For it is like the precious oil,
     poured out on Aaron’s head,
   that, running over, down his beard,
     upon his collar spread.

3. Like Hermon’s dew, upon the hill
     of Zion it descends.
   The Lord bestows his blessing there –
     the life that never ends.


Psalm 134  O bless our God with one accord

1. O bless our God with one accord,
     ye faithful servants of the Lord,
   who in his house do stand by night;
     and praise him there with all your might.

2. Lift up your hands, in prayer draw nigh
     unto his sanctuary high;
   bless ye the Lord, kneel at his feet,
     and worship him with reverence meet.

3. Jehovah bless thee from above,
     from Zion in his boundless love,
   our God who heav’n and earth did frame;
     blest be his great and holy name.


Psalm 135  Praise the Lord, all you his servants!

1. Praise the Lord, all you his servants!
     Praise his name with glad accord,
     you who serve God in his temple,
     in the dwelling of the Lord.
   Praise the Lord, for this is fitting.
     He is good; his praise proclaim.
     Praise the Lord, for it is pleasant
     to sing praises to his name.

2. For the Lord has chosen Jacob
     to belong to him alone.
     Israèl to be his treasure,
     set apart to be his own.
   For I know the Lord is mighty;
     greater than all gods is he.
     He is sovereign in the heavens,
     on the earth and in the sea.

3. He makes thunderclouds to gather
     from the earth’s remotest shores;
     with the rain he sends forth lightning,
     brings the wind out from his stores.
   He struck down all Egypt’s firstborn;
     man and beast alike were slain.
     Mighty signs he showed in Egypt,
     routing Pharaoh and his men.

4. Many nations he defeated;
     kings he slew with mighty hand –
     Og of Bashan and King Sihon,
     all the kings of Canaan’s land.
   All their lands he gave to Jacob,
     to his people Israel;
     as a heritage he gave them
     lands where they might safely dwell.

5. Lord, your name endures forever;
     your renown is ever great.
     For the Lord sustains his servants
     and his folk will vindicate.
   But the idols of the nations,
     made of silver and of gold,
     are by human hands created
     with a hammer or a mould.

6. Mouths they have, but speak they cannot;
     eyes they have, but cannot see.
     Ears they have, but hear they cannot;
     in their mouths no breath can be.
   Those who make them will be like them;
     those who trust them are the same.
     Praise the Lord, O house of Israel;
     Aaron’s house, exalt his name.

7. Praise the Lord, O house of Levi;
     you who fear him, praise the Lord!
   Praise the Lord who dwells in Zion!
     Praise the Lord who dwells in Zion!
     Praise the Lord who dwells in Zion,
     in Jerusalem praise the Lord!


Psalm 136  O thank the Lord, for he is good

1. O thank the Lord, for he is good;
     his love endures forever.
   O thank the God of gods always;
     his love will fail us never.
   Give glory to the Lord of lords;
     his love endures forever.
   Great wonders he alone performs;
     his love will fail us never.

2. In wisdom he has made the heavens;
     his love endures forever.
   He set the earth above the seas;
     his love will fail us never.
   He made the sun to rule the day –
     his love endures forever –
   the moon and stars to rule the night;
     his love will fail us never.

3. He struck down Egypt’s firstborn sons;
     his love endures forever.
   By might he brought out Israel;
     his love will fail us never.
   He made a pathway through the sea;
     his love endures forever.
   And through it he brought Israel
     his love will fail us never.

4. The Lord drowned Pharaoh and his host;
     God’s love endures forever;
   his own led through the wilderness;
     his love will fail us never.
   Thank him who struck down mighty kings –
     his love endures forever –
   and slaughtered kings of great renown –
     his love will fail us never –

5. King Sihon of the Amorites –
     God’s love endures forever –
   and Og, the king of Bashan, too;
     God’s love will fail us never.
   He made their lands a heritage –
     his love endures forever –
   for his own servant Israel;
     his love will fail us never.

6. He thought upon us in our need;
     his love endures forever;
   and freed us from our enemies;
     his love will fail us never.
   To every creature he gives food;
     his love endures forever.
   Give thanks to God, the God of heaven;
     his love will fail us never.


Psalm 137  By Babel’s streams we sat and wept

1. By Babel’s streams we sat and wept,
     for memory still to Zion clung.
   The winds alone our harp strings swept,
     that on the drooping willows hung.

2. There our rude captors, flushed with pride;
     a song required to mock our wrongs;
   our spoilers called for mirth and cried,
     “Come, sing us one of Zion’s songs.”

3. Not songs but sighs to us belong
     when Zion’s walls in ruin lie;
   how shall we sing Jehovah’s song
     while in an alien land we die?

4. O Zion fair, God’s holy hill,
     wherein our God delights to dwell,
   let my right hand forget her skill
     if I forget to love thee well.

5. If I do not remember thee,
     then let my tongue from utterance cease,
   if any earthly joy to me
     be dear as Zion’s joy and peace.

6. Remember, Lord, the dreadful day
     of Zion’s cruel overthrow.
   How happy he who shall repay
     the bitter hatred of her foe.


Psalm 137b  By flowing waters of Babylon

1. By flowing waters of Babylon
     we hung our harps on the willows:
   how shall we sing our Jehovah’s song
     in a foreign land, far away?

2. They who oppress us and mock our grief
     tell us to sing and be merry:
   how can we worship when spirits fail
     in an alien land, far away?

3. If we forget you, Jerusalem,
     may we keep silence forever!
   Still we remember our distant home
     in another land, far away.


Psalm 138  With grateful heart my thanks I bring

1. With grateful heart my thanks I bring,
     before the great thy praise I sing.
     I worship in thy holy place
     and praise thee for thy truth and grace;
   for truth and grace together shine
     in thy most holy word divine,
     in thy most holy word divine.

2. I cried to thee and thou didst save,
     thy word of grace new courage gave.
     The kings of earth shall thank thee, Lord,
     for they have heard thy wondrous word.
   Yea, they shall come with songs of praise,
     for great and glorious are thy ways,
     for great and glorious are thy ways.

3. O Lord, enthroned in glory bright,
     thou reignest in the heav’nly height;
     the proud in vain thy favour seek,
     but thou hast mercy for the meek.
   Through trouble though my pathway be,
     thou wilt revive and strengthen me,
     thou wilt revive and strengthen me,

4. Thou wilt stretch forth thy mighty arm
     to save me when my foes alarm.
     The work thou hast for me begun
     shall by thy grace be fully done,
   forever mercy dwells with thee;
     O Lord, my Maker, think on me;
     O Lord, my Maker, think on me.


Psalm 139  O God, you search me

1. O God, you search me and you know me;
     all my thoughts lie open to your gaze.
   When I walk or lie down you are before me;
     ever the maker and keeper of my days.

2. You know my resting and my rising;
     you discern my purpose from afar.
   And with love everlasting you besiege me;
     in every moment of life and death, you are.

3. Before a word is on my tongue, Lord,
     you have known its meaning through and through.
   You are with me, beyond my understanding;
     God of my present, my past and future, too.

4. Where can I go, Lord, from your Spirit?
     Oh, to flee from you I know not where.
   If I rise up to heaven, there I find you,
     and if in death I seek refuge, you are there.

5. If e’en the wings of dawn should hide me,
     or the distant reaches of the sea,
   even there will your loving hand still guide me,
     and with your right hand, so strong, lay hold on me.

6. If I think darkness should protect me
     and the light should hide me from your sight…
   But the night and the light alike to you are;
     even the darkness, as day, to you is bright.

7. For all my being you created;
     in my mother’s womb you knit the whole.
   What a fearful and wondrous thing you’ve made, Lord!
     I know it well. O give thanks to God, my soul.

8. My frame could not be hidden from you
     when in secret depths you shaped my form.
   And my days were all numbered and recorded,
     each one ordained though I had not yet been born.

9. How precious are your thoughts to me, God.
     Their great sum – it’s more than I can view!
   Should I count them, the sand they would outnumber.
     When I awake, I find I am still with you.

10. O God, that you would slay the wicked –
     go from me, all you bloodthirsty men –
   for with evil designs they speak against you;
     your holy name they take on their lips in vain.

11. O Lord, I hate all those who hate you,
     and those who resist you I deplore
   with a hatred intense as I can muster.
     My enemies are all they whom you abhor.

12. Search me, O God, and know my heart well.
     All my anxious thoughts please test and know.
   See if any offensive way be in me
     and in the way everlasting lead me home.


Psalm 139b  Lord, thou hast searched me

1. Lord, thou hast searched me and dost know
     where’er I rest, where’er I go;
   thou knowest all that I have planned,
     and all my ways are in thy hand.

2. My words from thee I cannot hide.
     I feel thy pow’r on every side.
   O wondrous knowledge, awful might,
     unfathomed depth, unmeasured height!

3. Where can I go apart from thee,
     or whither from thy presence flee?
   In heav’n? it is thy dwelling fair;
     in death’s abode? lo, thou art there.

4. If I the wings of morning take,
     and far away my dwelling make,
   the hand that leadeth me is thine,
     and my support thy power divine.

5. If deepest darkness cover me,
     the darkness hideth not from thee;
   to thee both night and day are bright,
     the darkness shineth as the light.

6. All that I am I owe to thee;
     thy wisdom, Lord, has fashioned me.
   I give my Maker thankful praise,
     whose wondrous works my soul amaze.

7. Ere into being I was brought,
     thine eye did see, and in thy thought
   my life in all its perfect plan
     was ordered ere my days began.

8. Thy thoughts, O God, how manifold,
     more precious unto me than gold!
   I muse on their infinity.
     Awaking, I am still with thee.

9. The wicked thou wilt surely slay;
     from me let sinners turn away.
   They speak against the name divine;
     I count God’s enemies as mine.

10. Search me, O God, my heart discern;
     try me, my inmost thought to learn;
   and lead me, if in sin I stray,
     to choose the everlasting way.


Psalm 140  Save me, O Lord

1. Save me, O Lord, from evil men;
     from violent men protect my way,
     for evil schemes are in their hearts,
     and war they stir up every day.
   Like snakes, their tongues have sharpened tips
     with vipers’ poison on their lips.

2. Keep me, O Lord, from wicked hands;
     from men of violence set me free,
     for they conspire to trip my feet.
     The proud have hidden snares for me;
   they spread the meshes of their net,
     and on my pathway traps are set.

3. O Lord, I say, “You are my God.”
     Lord, listen to my cry for aid.
     O Sovereign Lord, my Saviour strong,
     in battle you protect my head.
   Refuse the wicked their desire;
     to shame them, make their plots misfire.

4. O Lord, let those who hem me in
     be overwhelmed by their own lies.
     Let burning coals upon them fall;
     from deepest pits may they not rise,
   May liars find no place to stay,
     the vi-o-lent be swept away.

5. I know it is the Lord alone
     whose judgment vindicates the poor;
     it is the Lord who will uphold
     and make the needy’s cause secure.
   To you the righteous praise will give;
     the upright in your sight will live.


Psalm 141  O Lord, I call to you

1. O Lord, I call to you.
     Come quickly! I’m in need!
   And, when I cry to you for help,
     to my appeal give heed.

2. Like incense may my prayer
     before your face arise –
   the raising of my hands be like
     the evening sacrifice.

3. Keep watch, Lord, on my mouth,
     and guard my lips, I pray;
   let not my heart to evil thoughts
     be drawn and led astray.

4. Keep me from taking part
     in what the evil do;
   let me not taste their choicest food,
     lest I be false to you.

5. A righteous friend’s rebuke
     will be a soothing balm;
   such blows, in kindness aimed at me,
     will never do me harm.

6. Against the wicked’s deeds
     I make my constant prayer,
   their rulers will be thrown from cliffs,
     and they will perish there.

7. The wicked then will know
     my words were spoken well.
   Like ground that’s ploughed, their bones are strewn
     before the mouth of hell.

8. But now, O Sovereign Lord,
     on you I fix my gaze;
   do not deliver me to death –
     you are my help always.

9. Protect me from the traps
     the wicked set for me,
   and let them be ensnared themselves,
     while I instead go free.


Psalm 142  I cry for mercy

1. I cry for mercy to the Lord;
     to him I lift my voice in prayer.
   Before the Lord I bring my plea;
     to him my trouble I declare.

2. Each time my spirit faints in me,
     you are the one who knows my way;
   for in the path on which I walk
     a hidden snare for me they lay.

3. Look to my right hand and take note:
     there is not one concerned for me.
   I have no refuge; no one cares
     for me in my adversity.

4. I cry aloud to you, O Lord:
     “You are my hiding place in strife;
   you are the one sustaining me;
     you keep me in the land of life.”

5. Lord, listen to my cry for help,
     for I am in extremity.
   Save me from those who seek my life,
     because they are too strong for me.

6. So that I may give thanks to you,
     from prison’s darkness set me free.
   The righteous then will gather round,
     because you’ve shown your love to me.


Psalm 143  Hear now my prayer, O Lord

1. Hear now my prayer, O Lord;
     my cry for mercy heed.
     In truth and righteousness
     draw near to meet my need.
   And do not judge me in your sight
     for in your presence none is right.

2. The foe has hounded me
     and crushed me to the ground,
     in darkness made me dwell
     like those in death long bound.
   And so my spirit is afraid;
     my heart within me is dismayed.

3. Therefore I call to mind
     the days and years long gone;
     I ponder all your works
     and what your hands have done.
   To you in prayer I spread my hands;
     for you I thirst, like arid lands.

4. My spirit fails, O Lord;
     come quickly to my side.
     Hide not your face from me,
     lest to the pit I slide.
   Let morning bring your love anew,
     for I have put my trust in you.

5. To you I lift my soul;
     show me the way to go.
     I hide myself in you;
     Lord, save me from my foe.
   My God, teach me to do your will;
     may your good Spirit lead me still.

6. For your great mercy’s sake,
     O Lord, preserve my life;
     and in your righteousness
     deliver me from strife.
   In love, put all my foes to shame;
     destroy them, for I bear your name.


Psalm 144  All praise to the Lord

1. All praise to the Lord, who prepares me to fight;
     for he is my fortress, the rock of my might.
   Lord, why care for mortals, whose brief earthly stay
     is like fleeting shadows, soon passing away?

2. O Lord, part the heavens, reach down from on high;
     touch mountains with smoke, flash your fire in the sky.
   Lord, save me from those who deal only in lies;
     their hands are deceitful, your ways they despise.

3. I’ll sing a new song on a harp of ten strings.
     Lord, you are the one who gives victory to kings.
   Your hand keeps me safe from the foes’ deadly sword.
     Deliver me from the deceitful, O Lord.

4. Our children will blossom in beauty and grace.
     Our barns will be filled, sheep and cattle increase.
   No cry of distress in our streets will be heard.
     How blest are the people whose God is the Lord!


Psalm 145  I will exalt my God and King

1. I will exalt my God and King,
     and I will ever praise your name.
     I will extol you every day
     and ever more your praise proclaim.
   You, Lord, are greatly to be praised;
     your greatness is beyond all thought.
     From age to age your people tell
     the mighty wonders you have wrought.

2. On your most glorious majesty
     and on your deeds my mind will dwell.
     Your deeds will fill the world with awe,
     and all your greatness I will tell.
   Your matchless goodness and your grace
     your people will commemorate;
     and all your truth and righteousness
     our joyful song will celebrate.

3. The Lord our God is rich in grace,
     tender to us, compassionate.
     His anger is most slow to rise;
     his love and kindness are most great.
   The Lord is good in all his ways;
     his creatures know his constant care.
     To all his works his love extends;
     all creatures in his mercies share.

4. All you have made will praise you, Lord;
     your mighty acts your saints will show,
     till all the peoples on the earth
     the splendour of your kingdom know.
   Eternal is your kingdom, Lord,
     forever strong and ever sure;
     while generations rise and die,
     our glorious reign will still endure.

5. The Lord is faithful to his word;
     he will extend his gracious hand.
     The Lord upholds the faltering feet
     and makes the weak securely stand.
   The eyes of all look up to you
     for food and drink, which you supply;
     your open hand is bountiful,
     and every need you satisfy.

6. The Lord is just in all his ways;
     in all his works the Lord is kind,
     and all who call on him in truth
     in him a present helper find.
   He will fulfil the heart’s desire
     of those who fear him and obey.
     The Lord will surely hear their cry,
     will save them when to him they pray.

7. The Lord in grace preserves his saints,
     redeeming those who love his name.
     The wicked he will overthrow
     and put his enemies to shame.
   My mouth will sing the glorious praise
     of God, whom earth and heav’n adore.
     Let every creature praise his name
     forever and forevermore!


Psalm 146  Hallelujah, praise Jehovah, O my soul

1. Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
     O my soul, Jehovah praise;
     I will sing the glorious praises
     of my God through all my days.
   Put no confidence in princes,
     nor for help on man depend;
     he shall die, to dust returning,
     and his purposes shall end.

2. Happy is the man that chooses
     Israel’s God to be his aid;
     he is blest whose hope of blessing
     on the Lord his God is stayed.
   Heav’n and earth the Lord created,
     seas and all that they contain;
     he delivers from oppression,
     righteousness he will maintain.

3. Food he daily gives the hungry,
     sets the mourning prisoner free;
     raises those bowed down with anguish,
     makes the sightless eyes to see.
   Well Jehovah loves the righteous,
     and the stranger he befriends,
     helps the fatherless and widow,
     judgment on the wicked sends.

4. Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
     O my soul, Jehovah praise;
     I will sing the glorious praises
     of my God through all my days.
   Over all God reigns forever,
     through all ages he is King;
     unto him, thy God, O Zion,
     joyful hallelujahs sing.


Psalm 147  O sing ye hallelujah!

1. O sing ye hallelujah!
     ’Tis good our God to praise;
     ’tis pleasant and becoming
     to him our songs to raise.
   He builds the walls of Zion,
     he seeks her wandering sons;
     he binds their wounds and comforts
     the brokenhearted ones.

2. The starry hosts he numbers,
     he calls them all by name;
     his greatness and his wisdom
     his wondrous works proclaim.
   The meek he lifts to honour,
     he humbles sinful pride.
     Give thanks to him and utter
     his praises far and wide.

3. The heav’ns with clouds he covers,
     he sends the cheering rain;
     the slopes of all the mountains
     he fills with grass and grain.
   To beast and bird his goodness
     their daily food supplies;
     he cares for all his creatures,
     attentive to their cries.

4. No human power delights him,
     no earthly pomp or pride;
     he loves the meek who fear him
     and in his love confide.
   Then praise thy God, O Zion,
     his gracious aid confess;
     he gives thee peace and plenty,
     his gifts thy children bless.

5. He sends his swift commandment,
     and snow and ice enfold
     the world, and none are able
     to stand before his cold.
   Again he gives commandment:
     the winds of summer blow,
     the snow and ice are melted,
     again the waters flow.

6. His statutes and his judgments
     he makes his people know;
     to them as to no others
     his grace he loves to show.
   For matchless grace and mercy
     your grateful praises bring;
     to him give thanks forever,
     and hallelujah sing.


Psalm 148  Hallelujah, praise Jehovah

1. Hallelujah, praise Jehovah,
     from the heavens praise his name.
     Praise Jehovah in the highest,
     all his angels, praise proclaim.
   All his hosts, together praise him,
     sun and moon and stars on high;
     praise him, O ye heav’ns of heavens,
     and ye floods above the sky.

   Let them praises give Jehovah,
     for his name alone is high;
   and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
   far above the earth and sky.

2. Let them praises give Jehovah,
     they were made at his command;
     them forever he established,
     his decree shall ever stand.
   From the earth, O praise Jehovah,
     all ye seas, ye monsters all,
     fire and hail and snow and vapours,
     stormy winds that hear his call.

   Let them praises give Jehovah,
     for his name alone is high;
   and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
   far above the earth and sky.

3. All ye fruitful trees and cedars,
     all ye hills and mountains high,
     creeping things and beasts and cattle,
     birds that in the heavens fly,
   kings of earth and all ye people,
     princes great, earth’s judges all;
     praise his name, young men and maidens,
     aged men, and children small.

   Let them praises give Jehovah,
     for his name alone is high;
   and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
     and his glory is exalted,
   far above the earth and sky.


Psalm 149  Praise the Lord! Give him glory

1. Praise the Lord! Give him glory and sing a new song.
     Praise the Lord with his saints in the worshipping throng.
   To their Maker let Israèl joyfully sing;
     let the people of Zion be glad in their King.

2. Let his people with dancing give praise to his name,
     as with harp and with timbrel their God they acclaim.
   For the Lord in his people takes special delight,
     and he crowns with salvation the meek in his sight.

3. Let the saints shout for joy at the grace he bestows;
     let them sing and rejoice while they take their repose.
   May their mouths be employed in the praise of the Lord,
     and their hands be equipped with a double-edged sword.

4. They will punish the nations and captive will bring
     all the peoples of earth, every noble and king.
   They will execute judgment commanded by God.
     Thus his saints will be glorified. Worship the Lord!

   Praise him for his acts of power;
     praise him for his majesty.

     praise him with the harp and lute.
   Praise with tambourine and dancing;
     praise him with the strings and flute.

     with loud cymbals praise accord.
   Praise him, everything that’s breathing!
     Hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!

     far above the skies, the Lord.
     Praise God in his heav’nly glory.
   Praise him for his mighty deeds,
     who supplies us all our needs.
     Praise him for his awesome greatness.

2. With the trumpet praise the Lord.
     Harp and lyre, O praise your God.
   With the timbrel sound his praise.
     With the dance praise him always.
     Pipe and strings play to his glory.
   Praise him with the cymbal crash.
     Praise the Lord, all that has breath.
     Praise the Lord, sing hallelujah!


Hymn 151  On the good and faithful

1. On the good and faithful
     God has set his love;
     when they call he sends them
     blessings from above.
   Stand in awe and sin not,
     bid your heart be still;
     through the silent watches
     think upon his will.

2. Lay upon God’s altar
     good and loving deeds,
     and in all things trust him
     to supply your needs.
   Anxious and despairing,
     many walk in night;
     but to those that fear him,
     God will send his light.

3. In God’s love abiding,
     I have joy and peace
     more than all the wicked,
     though their wealth increase.
   In his care confiding,
     I will sweetly sleep,
     for the Lord, my Saviour,
     will in safety keep.


Hymn 152  The king of love my Shepherd is

1. The king of love my Shepherd is,
     whose goodness fails me never;
   I nothing lack if I am his
     and he is mine forever.

2. Where streams of living water flow
     my ransomed soul he’s leading,
   and where the verdant pastures grow
     with food celestial feeding.

3. Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
     but yet in love he sought me,
   and on his shoulder gently laid,
     and home rejoicing brought me.

4. In death’s dark vale I fear no ill
     with you, dear Lord, beside me,
   your rod and staff my comfort still,
     your cross before to guide me.

5. You spread a table in my sight,
     from enemies protect me;
   your presence is my chief delight,
     your grace is given freely.

6. And so through all the length of days
     your goodness fails me never;
   Good Shepherd, may I sing your praise
     within your house forever!


Hymn 153  In your wrath and hot displeasure

1. In your wrath and hot displeasure,
     chasten not your servant, Lord;
   let your mercy, without measure,
     help and peace to me afford.

2. Heavy is my tribulation,
     sore my punishment has been;
   broken by your indignation,
     I am troubled by my sin.

3. With my burden of transgression
     heavy laden, overborne,
   humbled low I make confession,
     for my folly now I mourn.

4. Weak and wounded I implore you;
     Lord, to me your mercy show;
   all my prayer is laid before you,
     all my trouble you now know.

5. Darkness gathers, foes assail me,
     but I answer not a word;
   all my friends desert and fail me,
     you alone my cry have heard.

6. Lord, in you I am confiding;
     you will answer when I call,
   lest my foes, the good deriding,
     triumph in your servant’s fall.

7. I am prone to halt and stumble,
     grief and sorrow dwell within,
   shame and guilt my spirit humble,
     I am sorry for my sin.

8. Foes about my soul are closing,
     full of hatred, false, and strong;
   choosing good, I find opposing
     all who love and do the wrong.

9. Lord, my God, do not forsake me,
     let me know that you are near,
   under your protection take me,
     as my Saviour now appear.


Hymn 154  Hail to the Lord’s anointed!

1. Hail to the Lord’s anointed,
     great David’s greater son!
   Hail, in the time appointed,
     his reign on earth begun!
   He comes to break oppression,
     to set the captive free,
   to take away transgression,
     and rule in equity.

2. He shall come down like showers
     upon the fruitful earth;
   and love, joy, hope, like flowers,
     spring in his path to birth.
   The king shall have dominion
     from sea to shining sea,
   and over every nation
     his peaceful rule shall be.

3. The desert tribes adore him
     and bend to him the knee;
   the wicked bow before him,
     his glory they will see.
   With gifts of adoration
     the foreign kings shall meet
   to pour the wealth of nations
     in tribute at his feet.

4. He comes with rescue speedy
     to those who suffer wrong,
   to help the poor and needy,
     and bid the weak be strong.
   He turns their sighs to singing,
     their darkness into light,
   for they, condemned and dying,
     are precious in his sight.

5. His kingdom is increasing,
     a kingdom without end.
   For him shall prayer unceasing
     and daily praise ascend.
   The mountain dews will nourish
     a harvest from the fields;
   the grain and fruit will flourish,
     the land its bounty yields.

6. In name forever glorious,
     he on his throne shall rest,
   from age to age victorious,
     all blessing and all-blest.
   Praise God, who rules each nation;
     tell of his deeds again.
   His glory fills creation;
     sing praise to God. Amen!

     the sins of long ago;
     in tender mercy visit us,
     distressed and humbled low.

     and glorify thy name;
     deliver us from all our sins
     and take away our shame.

3. In thy compassion hear
     thy prisoner’s plaintive sigh,
     and in the greatness of thy power
     save those about to die.

4. Then, safe within thy fold,
     we will exalt thy name;
     our thankful hearts with songs of joy
     thy goodness will proclaim.


Hymn 156  O God, our help in ages past

1. O God, our help in ages past,
     our hope for years to come,
   our shelter from the stormy blast,
     and our eternal home:

2. under the shadow of thy throne
     thy saints have dwelt secure;
   sufficient is thine arm alone,
     and our defence is sure.

3. Before the hills in order stood,
     or earth received her frame,
   from everlasting thou art God,
     to endless years the same.

4. A thousand ages in thy sight
     are like an evening gone,
   short as the watch that ends the night
     before the rising sun.

5. Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
     bears all its sons away;
   they fly forgotten, as a dream
     dies at the opening day.

6. O God, our help in ages past,
     our hope for years to come,
   be thou our guard while troubles last,
     and our eternal home.
