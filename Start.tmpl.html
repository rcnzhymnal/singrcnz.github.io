<p>
 <i><b>Sing to the Lord</b></i> is a psalter hymnal meaning that it contains arrangements
 of both the biblical psalms set to music, and also Christian hymns from the whole history
 of the Christian church.  It was first printed in 2013.
</p>

<p>
 The hymnal was made to be suitable for use in the Christian worship of God.  It was created by the
 Reformed Churches of New Zealand for their own use and for the benefit of all Christians.
 It contains poetic versifications of the Psalms faithful to Scripture, and a wide variety of hymns expressing
 sound biblical thought and Christian experience.
