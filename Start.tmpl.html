 <i><b>Sing to the Lord</b></i> is a &lsquo;psalter hymnal&rsquo;, meaning that it contains arrangements
 of both the biblical psalms set to music, and also a wide variety of Christian hymns that express sound biblical
 thought, taken from the whole history of the Christian church.  It was first printed in 2013.
</p>

<p>
 The hymnal was made to be suitable for use in the Christian worship of God. It was created by the
 Reformed Churches of New Zealand for their own use and for the benefit of all Christians.
