</p>

<ol>
 <li>Select poetic Psalm versions faithful to Scripture.</li>
 <li>Select hymns in significant quantity for the various preferences in our churches.</li>
 <li>Solicit contributions from a wide cross-section of our membership.</li>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>
 A name, <b><i>Sing to the Lord (provisonal)</i></b>, has been chosen for the provisional printing of just the Psalms. It is our current intention to use this same name for our final non-provisional hymnal. You can still browse the <a href='Name.htm'>various names</a> that were submitted to the committee as options.
 </p>

<p>
 In <b>Aug 2008</b>, Lord Willing, we expect the arrival of the provisional printing of the psalter: Sing to the Lord (provisional). The committee has now embarked on the second stage of this project, the selection of hymns for the final hymnal. As we complete our proof reading, these will become <a href='Songs.htm'>available here</a> on this website.
 </p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>
 The Synod plans to publish this as a <a href='In a Book.htm'><b>book</b></a>, and has adopted this <a href='Statement of Principle.doc'>statement of principle</a> for the purpose. To help enhance our appreciation of the Psalms, these are the features of the <b>Psalms Section:</b>
</p>

<ul>
      <li>Number the songs by <b>Psalm number</b>: 1a, 1b, 2a, ...</li>
      <li>Choose words which <b>follow Scripture</b> more closely, while maintaining the poetry.</li>
      <li><b>Use up-to-date language</b> in most selections.</li>
      <li><b>Retain the good tunes</b> from our current hymnal and <b>replace</b> the poor ones.</li>
      <li>Choose one <b>main tune</b> that covers the whole Psalm, with a <b>summary psalm or alternate tune where appropriate.</b></li>
      <li>Most of these changes help with <a href='Scripture Memory.htm'>memorising Scripture (click)</a>.</li>
</ul>
In the <b>Hymns section</b> we plan to:

<ul>
      <li><b>Retain</b> good and well-loved hymns and <b>replace</b> the poor hymns.</li>
      <li><b>Add hymns</b> according to the variety of preferences in our churches (we need <a href='Contributions.htm'>your help</a>).</li>
      <li><b>Update language,</b> but only where necessary for meaning.</li>
</ul>
