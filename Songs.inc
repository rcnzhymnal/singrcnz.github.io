<h2>Songs Done so Far</h2>

<p>
 <b>Copyright:</b>      This music is <a href='Copyright.htm'>copyright</a> and may not be copied except according to these <a href='Copyright.htm'>details</a>. Note, however, that publication permission for the <b>Sing to the Lord (provisional)</b> psalter has already been published and anything may be freely sung from that publication.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Projection:</b> Most of the songs may be projected for public singing. We hope to be making powerpoint slides of all the Psalms available by October 2008. However, a few of these are subject to this <a href='Projection.htm'>special handling</a>.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Viewing:</b>         The first time you click a view/play link, you will be asked to download a browser plug-in called Scorch to play the file.  This plug-in will let you play and sing-along while you view the file. <b>Note:</b> If you get the message <b>"The score did not load successfully"</b>, follow the procedure <a href='Support.htm'>here</a>.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Parts:</b>             We may have included parts to help the choir-singers play-along and learn their part.  Just click on the correct SATB icon before the song name (SATB stands for Soprano, Alto, Tenor Bass).  Note that these parts are auto-generated from the full-part score, and may contain errors where there is complicated harmony.  We do not intend to fix these.
