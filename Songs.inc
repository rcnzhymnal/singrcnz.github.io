<h2>Songs Done so Far</h2>

<p>
 <b>Copyright:</b>      This music is <a href='Copyright.htm'>copyright</a>
 and may not be copied except according to these <a
 href='Copyright.htm'>details</a>. Note, however, that publication
 permission for the <i>Sing to the Lord (provisional)</i> psalter has
 already been obtained and anything may be freely sung from that
 publication.
 </p>

<p>
 <b>Projection:</b> Most of the songs may be projected for public singing.
 We hope to be making powerpoint slides of all the songs.
 However, some are subject to this
 <a href='Projection.htm'>special handling</a> and copyright restrictions.

<p>
 <b>Viewing:</b>         The first time you click a view/play link, the
 bottom of the page will ask you to download a browser plug-in called Scorch
 to play the file.  This plug-in will let you play and sing-along while you
 view the file. <b>Note:</b> If you have the CD that came with the <i>Sing
 to the Lord (provisional)</i> book, then you will find it easier to install
 Scorch from there.
 </p>

<p>
 <b>Parts:</b>             We may have included parts that choir singers
 can play to help learn their part.  Just click on the correct SATB icon
 before the song name (SATB stands for Soprano, Alto, Tenor Bass).  Note
 that these parts are auto-generated from the full-part score, and may
 contain errors where there is complicated harmony.  We do not intend to fix
 these.

 <b>Updates:</b>        These song pages will be updated <b>regularly</b>
