 The <i><b>Sing to the Lord</b></i> psalter hymnal was assembled by a committee
 appointed by the 2002 Synod of the Reformed Churches of New Zealand.  The committee's
 mandate was to:
 </p>

<ol>
 <li>Select poetic Psalm versions faithful to Scripture.</li>
 <li>Select hymns in significant quantity for the various preferences in our churches.</li>
 <li>Solicit contributions from a wide cross-section of our membership.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Singing the Psalms</h3>

<p>
 Many churches throughout the world highly value the singing of the biblical Psalms -- many
 of which were written for God's people to sing, and are God blueprint for good Christian song.
 Here is an <strong><a href='Restoring Psalm Singing to our Worship.pdf'>article on singing Psalms</a></strong>
 outlining how they are satisfying both emotionally and doctrinally.<sup>[<a 
 title='&ldquo;Give Praise to God&rdquo;, P&amp;R Publishing' href='ArticleCredits.htm'>credits</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
 These are the features of the Psalms section of this psalter hymnal:
 <ul>
      <li>Songs numbered by <b>Psalm number</b>: 1a, 1b, 2a, ...</li>
      <li>Words which <b>follow Scripture</b> closely, while maintaining English poetic metre.</li>
      <li>Use of <b>up-to-date language</b> in most selections.</li>
 </ul>

 These features help make memorising of the the Psalms easier, and if sung regularly in churches and families,
 will help us and our children become very familiar with the Bible's songbook.
</p>

<p>
 October 2008 saw the arrival of a provisional
 printing of the just the psalter: <i><b>Sing to the Lord (provisional)</b></i>. This was
 well-received, and was out of stock after some 2000 copies.  This provisional printing of the Psalms
 is now included as the first section of the full hymnal.
</p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s in a Book</h3>

<p>
 Having church hymnody in a traditional book has several advantages that presentation such as digital projection does not share.  Book form allows:
    <ul>
        <li>words and music to be published together which is beneficial for learning and singing the music well</li>
        <li>publishing of four-part harmony which is especially delightful for people who love to sing in parts</li>
        <li>taking our worship music home with us, making it available for use in a bible study group or around the dinner table</li>
    </ul>
 <i>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.&rdquo;</i> (Colossians 3:16)
