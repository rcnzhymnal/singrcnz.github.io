<h1>Name the Psalter Hymnal</h1>

<p>Name our New Zealand Psalter Hymnal. Simply send your suggestions to
<A HREF="email%3Fe=berwyn" ONMOUSEOVER="e=&quot;berwyn&quot;+String.fromCharCode(64)+&quot;brush.co.nz&quot;; this.href=&quot;mai&quot;+&quot;lto:&quot;+e; this.firstChild.nodeValue=e;">Berwyn
Hoyt</A> by November 2007. Names submitted so far are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The New Zealand Psalter Hymnal</li>
<li>Songs of Praise - Walter Walraven</li>
<li>Aotearoa Psalter - Margaret Haverland</li>
<li>Metrical Psalm Selections for New Zealand - Paul Davey</li>
</ul>

<p>We&rsquo;re about to <b><i>go to print!</i></b> &ndash; And in two
flavours: both hard cover and &lsquo;soft&rsquo;.  The committee preparing
our new Psalter hymnal is almost ready to release the first section. This
will be the entire book of Psalms released on CD. This is the
&lsquo;soft&rsquo; version, and much of it has also been recently released
on our <a href='Songs.htm'>hymns page</a>.</p>


<p>But the Reformed Church of Dovedale is also taking the initiative of
publishing this &lsquo;soft&rsquo; version in a real, high quality,
hard-cover book as a provisional work.  Now that is news worth talking
about.</p>

<p>But the book needs a name, and it would be nice to have the final name
even on this early edition.  The default name is New Zealand Psalter
Hymnal, and it is appropriate. But that&rsquo;s where you come in &ndash;
to provide a selection of name options for the final hymnal.</p>
