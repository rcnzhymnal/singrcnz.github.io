<h1>Name of the Psalter Hymnal</h1>

<p>You will recall that we solicited your opinions on names for our new
hymnal. In the end we chose <i>Sing to the Lord (provisional)</i> for
the provisional printing that was made.  We also tentatively plan to use
this name for the final hymnal. Your feedback is welcome.

<p>Other names that were not selected are listed below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The New Zealand Psalter Hymnal</li>
<li>Songs of Praise - Walter Walraven</li>
<li>Aotearoa Psalter - Margaret Haverland</li>
<li>Metrical Psalm Selections for New Zealand - Paul Davey</li>
<li>Pohutukawa Praise (red cover) - Lieda Brooks</li>
<li>Psalms and Hymns - Andrew and Lydia Nugteren</li>
</ul>
